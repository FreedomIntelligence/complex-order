what i really like about its quite , it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that i can throw it away and buy another one without blinking	1
this new click wheel ipod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch wheel for scrolling and click able buttons for selection	1
a decent piece of hardware with great speed \( i get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem \) and good signal quality	1
the best part about this router is now i have a dhaka server	1
the voice recorders good , but you can 't record songs off the radio for ring tones	1
they have a good concept here , and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative , so maybe they will do better with the next gen version , but for now i say buyer beware	2
i sent it back , as i think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective	2
one primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that i could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux , where soft modem drivers are hard to find , and don 't work very well	1
broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies	1
the games are decent , but u only get 2 to start off with	1
only if we could get one camera in it	2
this fixes some glitches such as the player freezing	2
the screen 's large and easily read	1
it has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass , but i usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish	1
very long lasting battery life	1
1 \) great audio quality overall	1
you can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call	1
you just can 't go wrong with this one !	1
this is not a router i would suggest for a novice user , my old dlink di52 !	2
2 \) no games it has a cool screen why not use it	2
i no longer use it as a plunge router , only as a stationary or table mounted router	2
just don 't get drawn into t mobile 's catchy rebate	2
silver metal case not plastic	1
well the champ has survived it 's first year with our son and it is great ! !	1
1 \) great sound \( 98db signal to noise ratio beats ipod 's `` unspecified `` ratio \) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head phones as well as external speakers	1
what a disappointment !	2
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong	1
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !	1
audio on video also lacking	2
sound excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice \( check cons \) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored	1
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers	1
if you hold down the scroll wheel too long \( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through \) , it will get `` stuck `` rapidly going through the songs and wo n 't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it	2
price , along with the replaceable battery \( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace as well as the hassle of returning it \) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad	1
	1
i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptable period of time for something to work	2
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market	1
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re entering my numbers	1
one bad thing though , i find the remote control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does	2
unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds even though they were not damaged in any way	2
the size of the camera is perfect	1
i have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it	1
since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t zones would work `` in 24 hours ``	2
a great camera , but here are some points which i don 't notice in most of the reviews here , which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer	1
the battery does not last 12 hours	2
so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it !	2
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price	1
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual	2
one neat thing i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms no problem for the camera rooms looked like they had ample lighting	1
but like i stated , its better then a trash can , but i 'm not sure if its better then the diaper genie	1
the photos in the address book are terribly scaled too they look as though they were built out of lego 's	2
i 'm sure i don 't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers , but i really like it !	1
though nearly a dozen different people at both t mobile and nokia have told me otherwise , it is simply not possible to use this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and many other devices	2
i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed	2
i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment	2
apex ad 2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw \( unlike sony or panasonic one supports only r rw and another supports r rw \)	1
2 \) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called `` unknown ``	2
i have had no problem either with backward compatibility , in that the `` mixed mode `` feature lets you both 54 and 11 mb cards off the router	1
my friend has an ipod , and although the sound quality probably won 't meet most audiophile standards , the product itself is better than anything creative has made	2
small size	1
i imagine if i left my player untouched \( no backlight \) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level	1
seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want	1
4 \) one nice thing about nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices	1
placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect	1
i couldn 't get the install wizard to work	2
of course one of the first things i did was write an email to the customer support at creative , through their website , and by the time they finally got back to me several working days later when they promise only one their suggestions were completely worthless	2
short warranty \( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy \) , occasional freeze up \( easily fixed by popping out battery \) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel	2
this is a great product , and canon has done an excellent job	1
scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models	2
this router was a huge disappointment	2
i 'm not sure why all the bad reviews , my computer isn 't especially slowed down and i have win '98	1
battery life is exceptional , lasting longer than the 8 10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market	1
in conclusion , i gave the ipod a 4 5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly	1
simple to use and hook up	1
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better	1
i am really impressed by this dvd player	1
other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better	2
however , configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours , and briefly made me reconsider my choice to for ego the airport and its notoriously easy setup	2
great phone	1
i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not \( like my apartment \)	1
it also has unproven battery life	2
last , i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this	2
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me	1
i have transferred in about 2 , 400 tracks so far very easy to use both the ipod and itunes	1
the latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of the states but still operates in many countries , excluding new zealand and australia	1
i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price	1
it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light	1
no problems now , just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has abandoned their customers	2
fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket	1
i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n 't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy	2
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement	1
by the way , it looks nice also	1
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse	1
this camera is great if you 're used to a high end slr	1
on my main computer the software did not work right	2
the little bag it comes with is cheap and useless	2
you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best	2
light , compact design	1
this is due to the unusually slow autofocus system	2
it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features	1
after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 of the dvds i put in it	2
unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n 't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything	2
limitations not a lot of original accessories like the ipod	2
am so glad i bought this camera	1
the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens	2
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !	1
we 've never experienced odor from the pail	1
the in program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well	1
i have tried other pails , but none have compared positively to the champ	1
but be prepared to buy something else \( diaper genie \? \) which can trap the odor better	2
solid , squeak free , large screen	1
overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast the capacity in the 20 gb is more than i think most people would ever need and , for the price , i highly recommend it	1
it films 10 second video , for crying out loud	1
large easy readable screen	1
this is the best purchase i 've made in a very long time	1
i simply love this feature	1
there will be much erasing of text as , one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters	2
power for the tech savvy , ease of use for the less fortunate	1
i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this router	1
output through component connections looks very good , on my non hd tv	1
but not good enough for me	2
my other nit is that it didn 't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything	2
great screen and great sound	1
this is a great product !	1
for looks , well ipod is head and shoulders better , both the iriver and creative zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming ipod	1
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them	1
again , this is a design flaw in the headphone !	2
and also , it 's priced very afford ably	1
i have owned some kind of creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support	1
overall an excellent phone	1
i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up	2
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version	2
it will not replace your high end 35mm slr but it 's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots	1
there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !	2
i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with `` bass boost ``	2
before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent \( for mp3 \) sound quality	1
the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality longevity of the buttons on the thing	2
is not as intuitive as i would like	2
buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non working computer	2
the battery , as others have said , also seems weaker than creative suggests	2
i didnt have any installation problems and the touch pad is fine , even if it is sort of inaccurate	1
the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on	2
the features are really cool like the radio	1
the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet	2
and the battery life is bad !	2
it is amazingly small , it 's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera	1
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality	1
its nice look is also a plus	1
the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n 't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again	2
1 the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more	2
i had a sony ericsson t610 before this and the t610 is far inferior	1
whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together	1
looks snazzy smaller than a pack of smokes easily transported ac charger included as well as a hard shell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter usb cable !	1
rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made	2
apple still does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini	2
the setup was a breeze , i had some reservations about a wireless network \( see my review for linksys wet11 \) but this item was on sale as well as the wet11 so i just had to splurge	1
but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n 't anticipate any problems with it	1
but if you use all bluetooth accessories , as i do , its really not an issue	1
if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can 't go wrong with the zen micro	1
i am very pleased with it so far	1
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button	2
while the software may not be as easy as i tunes , it is not difficult to use by any stretch	2
i can only hear the sound but no picture !	2
and it is extremely well priced for what you 're getting	1
but for what i do use it is perfect	1
i was an early purchaser of the wrt54g , and had a few problems with stability and speed finally , the march 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product !	1
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos	1
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period !	1
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general to moderate snapping	1
granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player	2
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch	1
this may be a really cool phone , but it 's not worth it with t mobile	1
decently sized screen one of the larger ones on the market at 2 ``	1
don 't worry this player rocks	1
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !	1
personally , i am very pleased with the diaper champ	1
this is an excellent router for the price	1
i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it	1
sound quality the ipod 's sound quality is pretty good	1
love the speaker phone	1
what is added in functionality \( battery replacement \) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off	2
mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs	2
\) worst feature possible , this alone makes it rate one star what 's up with no recharge cord \?	2
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones	1
i love that you can create custom playlists , and organize music in so many different ways	1
it also has tons more features then previous creative products , and most of them are very useful such as the ability to customize the main menu to show the stuff you want , not the default items \( creative labs com for more on that \)	1
if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera	1
it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and it 's fairly inexpensive as baby products go !	1
i don 't believe this camera is still available but if you can find one , you might like to get it	1
i 'll be getting a second one for my router table !	1
10 \) multiple play modes tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter	1
i downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem , but it hasn 't worked	2
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software	1
durability not good first problem , if you haven 't seen the news recently , the ipods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months	2
the product i rate five stars ,	1
i did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here	1
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod	1
the only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment	2
the device looks very cool , i think \( exactly as the photos promise \) , it 's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket , and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice	1
we also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped	2
the on off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera	2
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd rs fill of files \( e , mp3s \)	1
overall , the micro is a solid device and i haven 't fell into a problem with it yet knocks on wood	1
connect the player to your computer \( via usb \) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !	1
overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too	1
photo stitch \( merge pictures to create a panoramic one even my old one can do this and it 's really cool to have it now still \)	1
battery life is not long enough if and only if you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times the camera battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it 's normal	2
i love the es based controls and easy menus	1
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price i found both	1
the hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as i am now using medium diapers \( i have a 3 month old \) and they 're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact i make then and how un soiled they are	2
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome	1
the pictures are a little dark sometimes	2
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right	1
first , let me say that i got the 20gb ipod for christmas , and i most likely would not have spent the 300 myself	2
many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n 't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me	1
it has it all	1
it uses the extend able mmc memory , it is perfect for storing videos , pictures and mp3s	1
other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips	1
the sd500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months , and the lcd has been broken twice	2
who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a `` foreign `` computer just to move over some simple \( txt \) files \?	2
its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen	1
again , the headphone jack on this thing is garbage	2
there were many times when i clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens	2
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway	2
when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n 't there	2
the battery is nice	1
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website	1
1 the diaper champ doesn 't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find !	1
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted maybe 10 seconds of wait	2
i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk \( by accident \) as well as have played it outdoors in 30 fahrenheit weather \( by design \) and it has continued to work fine	1
i 've sent 10 e mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response	2
the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it \( i encode my songs at 192 256 kbps without variable bit rates \)	2
the digital zoom is crap	2
doesn 't have alot of good games on it	2
the ms scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar , over and over \( up to 1 hr , i then shut it down and used go back \)	2
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocally that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck	1
the height is a more convenient reach than others , where you have to hunch over	1
when the player was working it was great , but	2
for example , in auto mode you can 't use the flash redeye reduction , you must be in manual mode for that	2
it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily	1
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be unlike apple with the ipod	1
1 \) price gb of storage	1
this phone doesn 't include phone card calling	2
when i saw a high gain \( low price \) antenna was available to the wrt54g router , i thought i 'd happily give up some \( practically unattainable anyway , since you 've got to be in spitting distance from the router \) speed in favor of wider coverage	1
also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n 't always accurate	2
i like the size and weight of this little critter	1
i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up	1
there is also no voice recording , something most if not all mp3 players have that the ipod doesn 't	2
the creative zen micro is a zen micro killer , not an ipod killer	2
bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature but not on this player	2
i highly recommend this phone	1
this is a great camera for you !	1
the functionality on this camera is mind blowing	1
namely , it wouldnt sync	2
zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod	1
learning how to use it will not take very long	1
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior	1
ripping transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast \( even on a 1 1 usb \)	1
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen	1
even the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with `` mac settings `` , etc	2
as for bluetooth , no problems at all	1
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before	1
this is a nice feature \( i e it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to `` easy listening `` rather than `` heavy metal `` no problem	1
likewise , i 've heard norton 2004 professional version is fine too	1
it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen	1
this camera is so easy to use !	1
2 \) the champ uses regular store bags	1
otherwise , it takes very good pictures shutter delay is n 't so bad either	1
this is the first phone i know of that has the large bright screen , infrared , bluetooth , usb connector and a speakerphone	1
apart from speed , the signal is consistent and works without interruptions , etc	1
also , for those that complain that the diaper champ isn 't as effective as time passes , keep the following in mind as babies get older , their diets changes \( aka solid foods ! \) and so does the smell of their diapers !	2
i love the features on the ipod and the many things you can do with it	1
well , this apex dvd player turned out great !	1
bottom line great product , unbeatable price	1
software music match jukebox is n 't the greatest , the search function is n 't fast even when accessing it with the hot key shortcut	2
you can do so much more with the pc suite , i e free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jame you can even make your own apps games	1
the battery life leaves a lot to be desired	2
apple closed their island to anything that resembled microsoft , and clearly let napster know it could not use their products with napster 's services	2
i originally gave this camera 5 stars when i had windows 98 it was wonderful but i got a new computer last november with xp the usb software is soho not compatible with xp	2
this is a very light phone a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life \( not as long as the new polymer technology \)	1
the only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full	2
i 've had this player for more than 4 months and i 'm very happy with it	1
i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks available to me , but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill , concerts and programs being simulcast , npr , and on and on	1
i do like this phone overall \( would give it a 3 5 \) , but unfortunately , i am returning it	1
it 's perfect for those who aren 't planning on storing tons of music	2
the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical	2
the plug er gets stuck you have to manually extract the mess	2
all in all , creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features , and i look forward to the nomad zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype	1
regardless to this fact , i believe the champ is the best way to go	1
a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes	1
there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote	1
i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures	1
all in all it hasn 't been a bad product	1
i own this phone for about 6 months now , i have used the following features bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with outlook , transfer files \( movies , songs \) , i have many movies on it now with a 512mb memory card that it takes	1
the scroll button is overly sensitive at times not sensitive enough at others	2
the program is called nomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows software does	1
during install , nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so	2
the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful easy to use , high quality , and compact in size	1
now that i have all my music on it there has n 't been any more problems	1
transfering i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1 1 or 2 0	2
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well \( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc \)	1
the handles make it very comfortable to use and i experience little vibration	1
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket	1
to make matters work , there is no manual override to overcome this problem	2
price !	1
size bigger than the ipod	2
creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature	1
but this camera is great !	1
this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit	1
the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment \( for those of you who do n 't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight \)	2
my ipod freezes occasionally , which is especially annoying when you 're in the middle of a game of `` brick ``	2
i really love this phone	1
i dont especially like how music files are unstructured basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization , like you might have in windows explorer folders and sub folders	2
i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason	2
it was n 't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman	2
it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to	2
i 've connected the phone with two laptops and a ipa 4155	1
in fact , it supports the new wpa encryption standard , which is way better than wep	1
have tried calling \( 866 4apexgo \) , but can 't get through	2
well , it was nice while it lasted	1
the moveable lcd screen is great	1
nothing but hassle with this company	2
the zen lives up to the audio quality i love and expect	1
its ability to serve as a back up for my music collection is a huge plus	1
the total price with delivery \( free shipping \) was 135 !	1
if you don 't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive , i 'd re comment buying it to try out , and also buy an extra 2 year warranty for it \( there are some offered here , for about 15 dollars i think \)	1
but the product is elf is great	1
also , the wma compression format is superior to mp3 , especially at lower bit rates , so i needed a player that could handle wma and integrate well with my windows xp computers	1
it also lets you remove songs from the play order	1
the ear buds that come with it look cheap , but the sound quality is amazing	1
it is a bit difficult to get the unit open \( the advice to take it slowly is sound \) , but now that our son is walking and exploring , i consider this a positive attribute !	1
combine this with the excellent price we got in the gold box , and i 'm really happy	1
we just recently had to buy another roll of bags so 6 00 for a year of bags can 't beat that ! !	1
after upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine	1
1 \) player is not plug and play need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it	2
the battery life is amazing	1
the interface has a sassier flair and the blue lit trimming is an added bonus	1
also , not liking the gel case	2
now the bad 1 \) as usual , battery power not sufficient for daily usu age	2
battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k reeves	1
has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range	1
all the features are incredibly intuitive , even for a novice like me	1
let the champ win you over !	1
this isn 't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gon na play airplane with this , are you	1
another thing i don 't like is that some of the features take 1 2 seconds to load up	2
but since it 's so small , it isn 't a big deal to bring it with me	1
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly	1
the micro seemed like an ipod for less	1
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat clean clear and well focused on over 95 of all photos taken by a beginner	1
but i wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large diameter bits	1
it 's faster than wmp	1
on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured	1
nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now	2
for the price , i am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup	1
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be	2
i don 't have problems with the depth adjustment , the speed control , the collet \( i haven 't tried the 1 4 `` sleeve yet \)	1
setup in xp was instant and intuitive	1
the remote is flimsy feeling and awkward to use	2
it works well with my vip adapter , which is also a linksys	1
despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc	1
it 's easy and really works , with some incredible range	1
the light auto correction is awesome	1
the s100 's image quality rates in the middle of its class , but it can still be a reasonable choice for students , families , or small businesses looking for an ultra portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack	1
i do here a constant high pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough	2
i prefer things that are simple	1
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had	1
and the phone has a very cool feature which allows you to send images via a normal pop3 smtp e mail account	1
the diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into `` what diaper smell `` in less time than that	1
only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon	2
you also need to go in and manually remove many symantec files from the registry	2
the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings	2
as a windows user , i had to install the software including drivers and itunes on my desktop , and this is the only area where i encountered a nuisance	2
i found best results in most situation with manual center auto focus , manual mode , iso 100 \( shorter aperture time , so more often sharper images as with iso 50 \) , auto white balance \( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very well \)	1
even did while daughter sleep and no noise !	1
downside is the size of the phone , it is big for today 's standard	2
when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat	1
i 've had it for a week now , do n 't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it	1
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m 4m pixel fine combos and many of the user friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately	1
	2
too bad they don 't mention anything about how the cd can 't be used with a mac	2
for a sleeker , smaller and more `` average `` mp3 player the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water the interface is great and the design is wonderful	1
another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world	1
if i had to do it over again , even with the cost savings of using any type of bag , i would go w the diaper genie	1
its compact and has rounded edges	1
it has a classic design yet looks hip	1
another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load wav sounds as ringers	1
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides	1
and the biggest plus is that you don 't have to buy any expensive refills	1
i saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and i feel people are over exaggerating the menu load time	2
i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images	1
anything this phone does , it does perfectly	1
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !	1
i don 't know what 's happened to norton , but 2004 is absolute garbage	2
i 've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far , and i 've not to get either product working properly	2
this product is too fragile for normal use	2
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there it is unbelievably small and oh , so light	1
anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception	1
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer	1
verdict had i not needed something with a tad bit more space , i consider this player fair game	2
looks and shape i have a black one and the first time i charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool	1
its really cool	1
the camera was a marvel	1
the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n 't wash my car	1
it works well enough \( so far \) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something	1
we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working	2
the interface used could be better designed	2
i find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on	2
it 's overkill for simple snapshots , unless you 've got way too much money to blow	1
putting in mp3 player , lots of games and application to download	1
i would recommend this camera unequivocally !	1
possibly the biggest advantage this player has \( if price was n 't enough \) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery	1
first of all , i 've never been big on earbuds they 're just not that comfortable	2
the antivirus feature is phenomenal , and is regularly updated	1
\) no locked in proprietary business like apple this baby plays wmas too	1
the included headphones suck , so get your own	2
it all sounds great too	1
i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive	2
3 \) user replaceable battery	1
there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec norton site	2
it works easily with one hand , which is important	1
the more i work with it , the more i love it !	1
the sound quality is also nice after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with	1
even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast	2
unfortunately , after loading 280 songs , all i get now is `` player either not connected or busy ``	2
the software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the creative software , windows media player 10 , or simply windows explorer to move music back and forth between your zen touch	1
got a `` system error `` problem 30 days after purchase	2
yeah this program protects your computer all right by locking you off the internet	2
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision	1
even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity	1
long reboots due to norton taking forever to boot	2
software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n 't mind buying notmad	2
it practically plays almost everything you give it	1
otherwise , i am extremely please with the creative zen micro 5gb mp3 player	1
mediasource did not recognize my tags !	2
my first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful	2
overall i like it	1
the bass treble the sound detail is aw some	1
you 'll love it !	1
the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so	1
it definitely keeps the smell out	1
i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed	1
other than that , the simian series 60 os is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you 're willing to hunt for it	1
so far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections	1
you do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the champ	1
but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad	1
reviews for sound quality are generally \( but not universally \) positive	1
i 'd say that this camera is perfect	1
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent	1
if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket , take great pics and video , get the sd500	1
i will also say that setting up the e mail account was very simple and straight forward , although you do need an external smut server to use	1
this is probably one of the few dvd players at 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it	1
give each friend a different ringtone	1
the customer support is pathetic	2
whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers , this is the truly the only diaper pail to get !	1
i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds	2
i was more excited about this player upon opening than i was about the nomad	1
remote you can stand it on end \( harder to lose \) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s	1
it also has a voice recorder and fm radio that you can only get on an ipod if you but an adapter seperately	1
i actually purchased two phones recently \( this one at the new blackberry phone \) , and this one is far superior \( imho \)	1
i got it to use with the new 5 per month service from yahoo \( music unlimited , \) and despite the above issues , i love it	1
it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n 't cover up the ac jack	2
1 pictures wo n 't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable	2
cheap construction they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners	2
initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone , web browser and of course the built in camera	1
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery	1
the lcd screen was very large and readable	1
the ipod package comes with everything you need , the ac adaptor , firewire cable \( quicker than usb , but slower than usb 2 which it also gives \) , those snazzy and power full headphones , and of course the player	1
it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim \( personal information manager i e organizer \) , and the radio !	1
if you 'll only read the whole manual , you 'll find out even more cool features and you 'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading	1
when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is	1
battery a big big plus	1
overall i like the unit	1
it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid	1
it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth precisely	1
lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy	1
having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying	2
although , i thought it could 've been designed a bit better	2
the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class	1
it was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers	1
its stable , so a curious toddler can 't easily tip it over	1
player has a problem with dual layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2	2
works great , no odor , and uses regular bags	1
the heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything i threw at it	1
there is also a small covering for the lens , so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched	1
the software , mediasource , can not work on my pc \( laptop , intel p4 2 0 , xp os \)	2
no more banner ads , pop ups , and the reliable antivirus	1
you indefinitely appreciate the small size	1
if you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged , they charge you roughly 105 50 per minute and blame you for `` abusing `` your ipod	2
it was also the most appealing	1
one downside as of this writing , t mobile has n 't updated their t zone system to fully support the 6610	2
the 6600 has more amenities than most world phone , camera \( vga zoom night mode timer \) , video \( w audio zoom \) , speaker \( good sound \) , bluetooth , infrared , modem for computers , electronic wallet , internet access , calendar , calculator , converter and more	1
that 's when it went from oder less , to odorous !	2
it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds	1
the video recorders a bit odd , sometimes i get 9 secs on my recordings , sometimes i get 17	2
outstanding signal reception	1
this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways	1
really happy with this little camera	1
dont rely on t mobile rebates	2
but i had to give you four because the service for my brand new ipod was terribly slow	2
all in all , this is a great phone	1
the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc other niceties , that you would enjoy	1
i enjoy getting use to the touch pad	1
everything , so far , has worked flawlessly	1
the os is ab it confusing at 1st , but within a few days you will pass this learning curve !	2
i have had no problem what so ever with this product	1
creative software stinks	2
after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift	2
it 's easy to use \( just a flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone ! \)	1
equipment included is average , but that is n 't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for	1
it powers up quickly , so you won 't miss that quick shot	1
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is	1
i find this to be a great feature	1
9 3x built in optical zoom is a lot for this price range	1
finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best	2
price and capacity	1
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly	1
i like the auto fit feature you can stretch wide screen dvd 's to normal	1
i tell you now , after lot of shooting in many different situations , this camera is amazing	1
the volume level of the phone is not all that good	2
these include mp3 , wave , wma , wma pro , and wma loss less it is very user friendly simply by right clicking the file \( s \) to be converted	1
the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating	2
the transmission speed is also quite good , with pages loading very quickly	1
wo n 't play a lot of discs	2
5 \) its focusing system is also very flexible	1
the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate	1
if you use linux and want gr ps and or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device , and want a decent camera this is the phone for you	1
on the whole , i 'm quite happy with the purchase	1
it sends discontinuous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment	2
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod \( except for a cumbersome work around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player \)	1
imagine my shock and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex	2
the zen micro is smaller than it looks in pictures , and feels very solid	1
we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems	1
but from my experience , by the time it gets to that point , the bag is really heavy , so i think this is kind of helpful it 's a built in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying	1
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n 't take up space on your pc hard drive	1
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad	2
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera	1
downside it takes a long time to start up	2
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality	1
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either the case is sturdy and offers very good protection	1
it 's fast , feels great in your hand and looks great too	1
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on your sound quality , the sound might crack	1
the darn thing works as promised and it 's amazingly cheap too	1
the only con i can think of is the lack of a mega pixel camera	2
great design very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied \( virtual ones are the only competition \) and now the wheel clicks , taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus	1
the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily	1
some more manual control would have been nice	2
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n 't make that big of a disturbance	1
it holds quite a few diapers , and pops them in quickly and easily	1
the only thing i don 't like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card , first thing !	2
the fact that the `` 0 `` key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the `` `` key instead	2
it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working	2
also , very light and portable	1
the interface works great	1
i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it	1
on the contrary , i 'm quite pleased with my upgrade	1
there are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact	1
stay away from this junk	2
i downloaded this set from norton , and within minutes my internet connection failed and my pc was almost dead due to registry problems from the download	2
the only way my pc internet works is if i open the firewall program configuration and manually refresh it	2
it may not top the ipod mini , but it 's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality	1
service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t mobile and aim is great	1
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective	2
1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone	1
the soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation	1
who in the hell needs a frigging vga camera on their cellphone \? \? \?	2
i 've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures	1
this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality , ease of use , and features	1
it takes a while to learn how to use it right , and at this point i am able to make about 70 of my calls using it	2
upon opening the box i was confronted with this small cute little mp3 player	1
it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket	1
right out of the box , i loved it , better features than the ipod , great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use	1
in a word , `` awesome `` is how i would describe this camera	1
i do not count this as a negative , however , because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up ! ! !	1
holy cow ! it really does scratch easily !	2
you don 't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a `` special edition `` to get black ! sound awesome ! batteries removable replaceable	1
the file ripping transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use	1
i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens ! ! !	1
the quality is superb	1
the touch pad does take a little getting used to	2
have had problems since the first day	2
whatever on to the negatives touchy about charging you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it 's life if you don 't upgrade the firmware or dont ' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side	2
get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings	1
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing	1
the sound quality is superb , much better than that of an ipod , in my opinion	1
it has a few inconveniences one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd	2
this dvd play is basically junk	2
the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it	1
\( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad \) there is no tiff format	2
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mils \( real estate broker software \) very well at all	2
kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that	2
it has plenty of power	1
this is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support	2
while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets	2
i also love that you can flip the device with one hand	1
sure , it slows it down a little , but that 's expected	1
this is a great diaper pail	1
all in all suprisingly easy to use	1
i like the speak phone function a lot	1
so , i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all	1
it 's being used daily and i have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers \( headphone jack , player locking up , etc \)	1
excellent sound i mean the player has juice	1
i have been absolutely , completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities	1
and , when you think about it , it 's insulting that norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops anyone who can provide proof of purchase , whether on the phone or online \( what if your computer is down \? \) , should have equal priority	2
this product has virtually all the same installation problems	2
the software is great	1
the only downside i see is that it does n 't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer	2
no offense to amazon , but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks \( i 'm sure prices here will continue to sink \) , and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space	1
the size is small \( just a little bit bigger than an i pod \)	1
this wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo quality printer \( with photo quality paper \)	1
i bought the diaper champ and have been very happy for the following reasons	1
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar	1
norton support is completely pathetic	2
i also like the fact that you can edit your mp3 titles , etc	1
battery non issue	1
the player kept displaying `` no disc `` , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as !	2
sometimes when you press buttons , the menu appears after a second or two	2
have had the player since xmas 's and love it !	1
transfering is easy , the software makes everything pretty easy	1
if you on the other hand always use automatic settings \( and not manual \) you should be just fine , as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen	1
because this camera is beautiful	1
otherwise , get a smaller single speed router , which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits	2
now he res the stuff you should know starting with the good things the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equalizer type deals on here	1
only 1 problem , no accessories yet	2
because steve jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an unrepeatable 18 month battery	2
even the battery life is great it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good	1
i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table	2
i didn 't have any major problems installing this software	1
the touch sarene navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it 's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies	2
the player is smaller than you think	1
the good 1 \) large lcd screen , colorful display , good resolution	1
the back of the ipod is in a chrome finish , and this surface is prone to scratches	2
and we still love it !	1
this phone is one of the best i 've ever used	1
the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors	1
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features	1
it was \( i sold it after a few months \) too expensive for the shots that i got	2
it 's good	1
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs	1
it 's oval and nice	1
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake	1
the karma is only 5 more , it 's small , had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including gog	2
i would however highly recommend the m12v router !	1
and bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as i thought it would , i usually can go 1 5 days with bluetooth on along with making calls before i need a full recharge	1
seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly \( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise \)	1
i got about 700 loaded up before it told me i was full , and at that point , i was ready to toss it out the window	2
one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu	2
its fast forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had	1
\( i never know when the champ is full as there is no way too tell even though not particularly aesthetic , how about making the champ clear and see through \? \) so , i lift the lid and find a wad of diaper , which i must remove , usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full	2
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited	1
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did	1
2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations	2
with bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long	1
then when i went to norton 's website to obtain a priority id number per the instructions i had been given , i couldn 't find a way to get one	2
however , the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'zen micro ' has to offer	1
focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange	2
smooth plunging ! \( it did stick a bit so i sprayed it w lubricant	1
i love this camera	1
no way to contact their customer service	2
the internet functions of the phone wap and gprs will only work through t mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network	2
the ipod mini is smaller and sexier , albeit limited in supported formats and the rio karma is a far better value	2
nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software	2
8 perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white correction settings \( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out \) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets	1
the player looks so much better when you 're actually holding it	1
i just went on a quick photo shoot in nyc 's central park today , and what a bunch of beautiful photos i took , if i do say so myself \( and i do ! \)	1
all in all , this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price	1
first , i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software	1
the colors are a joke , and i personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad	2
i 'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does , but for me the best thing is that i can easily check my email , movie times , news , or any website with this phone	1
i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great	1
you can see the lens barrel in the view finder	2
with the plunge lift all my bit changing has been done above the table , although i still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock \( and , of course , the speed and on off controls \)	2
the hitachi m12v is a dream to work with , smooth starts , adjustable speeds , micro adjustable depth , and plenty of power to spare	1
as for itunes , i don 't find it to be as good as the windows media player as a computer mp3 player , but it is good enough	1
the new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process	1
the diaper champ is the best !	1
and man i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title	2
overall , this product is awesome	1
this thing plays everything i feed it	1
take quick pictures with excelent resolution	1
like other reviewers , installation was hell	2
i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area \( suburbs \) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky \( cincinnati \) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i 75 , far superior to at 38 t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route	1
the great and versatile ipod	1
the only other problem with this router that i have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick , then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated	2
i have n 't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box	1
this camera has canon 's great calorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get	1
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had	1
also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls	2
the zen serves as a back up device as well as a player	1
very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures	1
i dont use the belt clip cz it fails to hold the player securely \( design problem \)	2
at any rate , if you have been interested in digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back , consider the canon s100 digital elph	1
there are instructions to encrypt your personal wireless network so no one else can end up hogging stealing your bandwidth	1
the use of 65536 \( 16bit \) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone	1
i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too	1
they play just about everything , but 2 and 3 died very shortly after getting them	2
my fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones	2
for the money apex machines have good features	1
the phone does not have an mp3 player , fm radio , 200k color screen , megapixel camera , quad band , pda , photo editor	2
so far i have no complaints with this player	1
however , setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze	1
sound quality is amazing i was expecting worse , but its really good \( especially if your files have good sound quality \)	1
i also own a canon digital rebel and i agree that the advanced controls on the sd500 are not as robust , but overall picture quality goes head to head with the digital rebel	2
if you are looking for an upgrade , this is definitely the phone for you	1
too costly and not efficient if you ask me !	2
i purchased this camera before it went on sale , and while i wouldn 't have minded keeping the extra , it was definitely worth it	1
the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me	2
but , for the money it is a good machine	1
just point and shoot and the photos were great	1
you can use it as a storage hard drive	1
there are no spec ail bags to deal with or buy !	1
we keep the diaper champ in our daughter 's nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers	1
everything else about the ipod is great , the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it	1
color screen is good	1
the major reasons i didn 't give it a five are one , i didn 't think the fine adjustment worked well	2
i had no problems following their installation instructions	1
the touchpad is virtually unusable sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don 't want	2
when i finally got it working , it only worked properly for many a month	2
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint	1
all the camera 's functionality is only available \( or selectable \) when the screen is functional	2
the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda willa	1
that said , i am disappointed in the plunging mechanism	2
noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah	1
when taking pictures of people , however , it shows every flaw in the subject 's skin	2
the interface is simple to use	1
in my table the m12v has been a real champ	1
one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space \( well , it is 38 gb in reality \)	1
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images	1
the earbud headphones are really nice	1
the supplied headphones are hands down better than the mediocre ipod buds	1
still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !	1
3 the nokia 6600 has a brilliant java interface	1
as a loyal customer of norton symantec products , i purchased internet security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product \( and hence the one star rating \)	2
i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !	1
it 's also easy to empty out	1
it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx	1
the software sucks	2
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class	1
the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market	1
the ones i 've kept \( porter cables , dew alts , bosch , and this hitachi \) have proven their worth over the years , however , when i need a real workhorse , i grab this router	1
the signal to noise ratio \( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave a larger stn ratio is better \) is nice and high at 98 decibels , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods	1
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of `` now playing `` interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical	1
i would recommend this product to anyone	1
most of us just want to plug and play , not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing	2
the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well	1
the dynamic range seems not quite as good as the kodak dc260	2
best in class	1
\) button sensitivity even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting , the buttons are far two sensitive , really takes some getting use to , and even then , it is still too sensitive	2
but this doesn 't make up for it 's innumerable other short comings , the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with liveupdate	2
they really are awfully small	2
also , their t zones , although cheap \( 4 99 mo \) never works	2
yes , the features are numerous	1
the zen plays mp3 , wma and wave formats , which makes it more versatile than the ipod	1
because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product	2
a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy	2
if you want to work wirelessly , this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now	1
i discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure , white balance , flash \( red eye , person against bright background , flash on , flash off , flash automatic \)	1
unlike other reviewers , i have found the support to be responsive , almost no wait time on the phone , and relatively knowledgeable	1
canon 's g3 does it consistently	2
i almost always get a good strong signal , even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest	1
i love the storage in this thing	1
1 record around 1 hour of video with phillips camcorder pro	1
all i have to say is that the pics i get with my sd500 are both rich and color and high in detail , the user interface is awesome , the battery charger is tiny and super light and sd cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time	1
even though you could get a cheap router these days , i 'm happy i spent a little extra for the linksys	1
both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best	2
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel	1
luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case , a finger	2
songs transfer lightning fast , and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time	1
they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department	1
to my amazement , even that process was error prone	2
i enthusiastically recommend this camera	1
the battery life is less than stellar , but it charges w the quickness	1
sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much	2
this phone is fantastic	1
but with a low price , comes lower quality	2
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine	1
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it	1
sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization	1
get it , it 's woth every penny ! !	1
i use the scented bags and even if i don 't no smell !	1
this camera has a major design flaw	2
thank you apple ! you make fabulous products	1
the headphones are not very comfortable , but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have	2
on several different occasions it has displayed `` no disc `` with a disc inside	2
after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem	2
it wouldn 't always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it	2
but if i installed either one of these norton products , neither works after installation \?	2
the other thing i do n 't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated	2
10 great price for all the features	1
it took me three days , to the tune of neil young 's song `` piece of cr ! `` , to get this to work with the satellite hookup i was hired to connect this wireless network up to	2
it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy	1
for instance , i made several back ups of my dvd movies using dvd r \( w \) and r \( w \) and it plays the dvds	1
the greatest thing about the software \( in my humble \) is that it reads your cd info	1
this is a quality product , not to be confused with the cheap junk that hitachi gets manufactured in china	1
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www ipod 's dirty secret com	1
handset quality is great , as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality	1
but for now it appears that this player does n 't play well with itunes	2
i love this camera !	1
well just one con its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze	2
awesome for the newbie , though i personally like to fasten every bolt myself	1
2 \) the body construction buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic	2
the only other problem was that security for the wireless connection	2
their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience	2
given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software	1
i took my zen micro with me over the weekend , and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason to keep the zen micro charged	2
no skips , and it hasn 't faltered once \( despite your inevitable drop or two	1
maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing	2
i do not need to repeat what 's great about this phone	1
this is a must have product for all new moms !	1
not compatible with audible com books	2
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best	1
i had tried to uninstall norton internet security a few weeks ago , and it wouldn 't let me do that either	2
huge storage space even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing	1
after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty	2
pros excellent sound , even with the headphones that come out of the box , but it absolutely rocked with my bose quiet comfort 2 set	1
capacity is not a problem here	1
all in all , its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use	1
if you are already using a previous version of nortron security and uni stalled it to install the new version , you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system !	2
although i find it more convenient to use 1 touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing	2
you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed	1
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n 't moving , the photos were awesome	1
best electronic i 've bought since i was born	1
unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks	2
even on the low sensitive level , a slight touch can skip or pause the track	2
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective	1
i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there	1
the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player	2
i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disappointed !	2
simple and it works !	1
i use the router with a 3 1 2in raised panel bit with no problems	1
the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake	1
even leaving it on the default setting \( without the eax enhancements \) produces crystal clear playback	1
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out	1
i got it working fast enough	1
the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ah wile	2
very small	1
i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n 't play certain disney and other dvd movies \( no disc message \)	2
each of the 4 lasted less than six months	2
the software was great , as long as you have an administrative user account \( windows xp \)	1
good looks	1
i think it 's great	1
buttons size is ok for me , my wife , but not my granny	2
besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !	1
the quick sync is n 't any good because it either needs to be configured properly or just is n 't very useful	2
the camera has a wonderful set of features	1
yin to point out they have experience , and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best	1
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred	1
i will never buy a creative product again	2
it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman	2
the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap is uncomfortable to use	2
the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god	1
when you dial a number , you 'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct	2
this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !	1
unarguably better than apple 's , and nice earbuds to boot	1
the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display	2
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone else 's is too	2
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind	1
hold button suprisingly not all mp3s have this this allows you to have all the buttons unusable , so that you don 't accidently hit something in your pocket	1
the camera 's a work of art science that 's understood	1
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far	1
a bit disappoint on that !	2
update january 27th 2004 the second one crapped out only after a week dont buy this product !	2
my brother had an old linksys b band wireless router in his home and it was like magic	1
b \) the screen is hard to read the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display	2
this player is absolutely phenomenal , i haven 't had any problems , and if you 're worried you will have problems , i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways i find the touch pad very easy to use , and i 'm surprised so many people have had problems	1
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies	1
the best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking	1
it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall , which i hear is a step up from the other ipods , which require you plug it into a computer to charge it	1
now this router is not the cheapest on the market	2
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on	1
it is slow to initially start up , but once it 's turned on , i 've never had any complaints about the speed	1
but , i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment	2
i click pictures in jog format and because the phone has a bluetooth device i find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth	1
the setup works awesome , as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for it 's merits , and not just the company as a whole	1
the camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great \( not as good as prints from my pro digital camera , but still very good \)	1
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy	1
the fact that you can assign ringtones to people and or groups is really cool	1
friends told me that the diaper genie did not work very well , so bought the diaper champ based on on line reviews and i have been happy with it	1
the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof	1
when the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money	1
this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks	2
what makes the focus lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8	1
again , every review written about the tech line is true after waiting close to 45 minutes i finally spoke to a rep	2
nokia makes great phones , and this one is the cream of the crop	1
can 't say whether i rec 'd an `` updated `` model but it will not read dvd rw 's or vcd 's for me	2
the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative	1
update i knew that i loved the champ , and using the diaper genie at a friend 's house really reinforced that !	1
1 small	1
my file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites	2
the phone itself is pretty nice	1
everything shines of quality	1
2 the scroll button is n 't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select	2
the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy	2
overall , a good buy for the price	1
weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does n 't show the complete file names of mp3s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting \( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1 2x , etc \) before getting back to normal size sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly	2
sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches	2
my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of	2
i have only used it with the 1 4 `` collet and a 1 2 `` round over bit , but i love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly	1
i was some what sceptically when i seen the price deference between the other makers of comparable hp	2
my old siemens s56 , on the other hand , worked beautifully with all of the above	2
but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses they will fix it for me if necessary	1
i would have liked to have given it 4 1 2 stars docking that 1 2 star only for the size	2
longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities	1
as far as user interface is concerned , the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player , 'creative mediasource organizer '	1
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding	1
f \) it doesnt look pretty spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the aesthetics bit down , of course	2
a \) feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	2
battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2 3 hours	1
another point of note the battery life is incredible !	1
pi ii 1ghz 512mb rd ram windows xp pro 80gb hd i was able to uninstall nis 2003 and install nis 2004 with no trouble	1
i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites	1
in auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera	1
user 's guide doesn 't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website	2
the zen was an impressive purchase and i would highly recommend it to anyone using napster	1
the zen micro fm receiver is ok , not great	1
if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly	2
excellent range of metering options as well	1
the stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk	1
the next problem was that it didn 't recognize all the installed components , so it would not update them , most notably and importantly , virus definitions	2
mixed bag i guess but the price was right	1
and really this is the best phone one could have	1
file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 0	1
the screen is clear and readable , and the touch pad works very well , it took me less than a day to get the hang of it , and now i like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control	1
extremely convenient	1
i must say , this one is quite slow to open an application	2
i have overall been disappointed with nokia in the past , finding that samsung and motorola tended to have better quality phones	2
i was looking for a compact , rugged \( i carry it hiking , skiing , boating , etc \) camera which is easy to use	1
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad	1
as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable	2
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable	1
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket	1
the startup time , quality of pictures and videos is outstanding	1
i have had several mp3 players over the past few years , and have to say that this by far is the best that i 've owned	1
the only complaint i have is that the 1 4 `` collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1 4 `` bits	2
once you set it up , it 's great	1
when i went to put in the new sd card i looked at the lcd screen cracked and the fluid gave a jackson pollock type appearance to the screen , black and blue and purple blotches and streaks useless	2
it 's as though nokia has segregated 90 of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10 for the day to day use	2
many of our disney movies do n 't play on this dvd player	2
apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment , and surprisingly wasn 't as expensive as its reputation normally holds	1
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games	2
i have stored around 60 cd 's \( at 160kbps \) on this and have barely touched the available memory	1
i would give it about 6 or 7 hours , although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles	2
the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person	1
on top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable , it is just a plunge router that works really well	1
the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better	1
it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it	1
so , why the small digital elph , rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality \? size 2	1
the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling	1
some movies it played yesterday , it wo n 't play today	2
having usb 2 0 makes for very fast transfers	1
it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice	1
i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1 2 x 11 with no vi sable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet \( super fine \)	1
the function lever the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile	2
it 's not the heaviest around \( i think porter cable has that distinction \) , but i found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation	2
i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal	2
5 stars all the way !	1
6 the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge it does not charge by usb cable this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient \( additional \) choice	2
other than this , i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again	1
it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do	2
i have not been disappointed with my purchase	1
nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try jog with it or something	1
the catch with the canon g3 camera , \( and perhaps all of digital cameras \) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots	2
sorts music by artist , album , genre , etc it 's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you 're looking for	1
i 've dropped it at least a dozen times to my recollection and it still works as good as ever	1
so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !	1
camera quality isn 't bad for the low resolution	1
on the downside , i think the interface takes some getting used to and the zen software !	2
the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered , and excludes my favorite feature in itunes , the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder	2
if i had to do it over , i wouldn 't buy anything else	1
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since	1
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse	1
but canon never fails to amaze	1
i bought this camera two days ago , and i 'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money	1
knocked 1 star off for the install wizard it wasted alot of time running it	2
it 's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers	1
the sliding latch is does not stay in place	2
it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear piece which is included	1
the battery life seems good , takes very little time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs	1
i still can 't believe how fast it starts up	1
they have the worst service of any of the major companies	2
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money	1
at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice	2
unfortunately , linksys does not write the best documentation	2
2 \) the delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots	2
while the perfect odor free diaper pail has yet to be invented , the diaper champ is a good as it gets	1
i never had a single problem	1
little to no networking experience , just in case the automatic cd method has issues	2
this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !	1
as said before this works perfectly	1
i just uninstalled systemworks and internet security for at least the fifth time due to functionality issues	2
from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly graphic meg atones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone	1
it is made of plastic	2
the price performance looked just right	1
symantec should give us all a refund and apology !	2
the battery holds a charge for a very long time \( maybe 15 or so hours of use \) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use	1
the vibrate setting is loud !	2
holds a lot of diapers a full week of toddler diapers !	1
you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly	1
the flash is very weak	2
the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well	2
but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there	1
transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software	1
the cool thing about the ad 2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd r 's	1
the voice recorder is a beautiful add on not even necessary , but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player	1
while i would like to give it 3 5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it	1
lens cap is a really annoying	2
diaper champ is great	1
although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon	1
also love waking up to music with attached speakers	1
weak points touch pad design could be better volume control controlled through the vertical strip , but purchasing a headphone with built in volume control will do the trick	2
the zen micro is no exception in addition to the case , it comes with a neck strap , and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging	1
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother	1
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price about 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player	1
as far as linksys goes , i have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well no problems	1
flawless	1
for the price and features it is really good	1
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod	1
the touchpad is great once you get used to it , and i much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels \( as on the dell dj for example \)	1
i 've yet to find the limitation for this hitachi \( my only hitachi tool , by the way \) and quite frankly , i don 't know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder	1
who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will	2
all of the wireless components that i bought were a breeze to set up as well	1
do not buy any home version of norton anything	2
the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry	1
the only drawbacks i 've encountered are 1 indoor shots from a distance 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr	2
i love the features , the interface , the size \( the screen is a delight \) , the camera \( though i admit i 'm not much of a camera user so just a toy for me \) , the internet connectivity , the quality , etc	1
why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20gb ipod that will hold 4 times the number of songs \( and even more if aac encoding is used \) for the same price \? \? \?	2
so far , the anti spam feature seems to be very good	1
the base was deeper and the highs were crisper	1
great sound ! i was very impressed , i encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great , especially with the better headphones	1
as i said , i don 't regret the purchase at all	1
sound quality is great , fm tuner is fine , as is the recorder	1
also , you can store data on it , which is a plus for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n 't bother , this is a much better buy	1
this is my fourth linksys product and , aside from the rough start , i 'm very satisfied with this router	1
and we definitely prefer our champ !	1
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always	1
applications it has lots of applications and they work very well when you eventually find where they are and they finally open	1
i simply hate symantec i swear , if i could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare , bleeding hands , i would have	2
i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever	1
i thought the software was decent enough it was n 't complicated to learn at all	1
this camera uses a lithium battery , i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient because what if you are on vacation , where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there	2
i use it in the table \( never take the springs out just attach the fine adjustment knob \) , in my woo drat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances	1
but it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2 1 mp camera	1
\( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them \)	1
ultimately you will learn just how bad nokia is , and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved	2
i got this phone yesterday and didn 't find any problems with it yet	1
the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap \( it is not very snug and can come off too easily \) and the lens itself \( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd \)	2
i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature , and the zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality , with no need to upgrade the earphones	1
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street	1
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vb files which i created with smart ripper	1
as any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had simone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image appeared on the decently sized screen	1
mine was so bad i had to to use a hammer to free it \( and this is why i 'm giving it 4 , not 5 stars \)	2
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera	1
surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available	1
i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n 't a big problem	2
works great !	1
4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use \( has a great swivel lcd screen \) , a lot of features and add on options , comes with great software \( not to be overlooked \) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval \( two thumbs up ! \)	1
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to date	1
however , for a 600 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice	1
not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have	1
the only problem is the battery life	2
i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high end player	1
when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra it 's that good !	1
also , you have to use it with itunes or they 'll sue , dammit ! but itunes is about as good as anything	1
however , i am very disappointed with this product and with symantec	2
while i have not had the `` privilege `` , as many call it , of owning an ipod , based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their ipod \( and subsequently purchased the zen touch or zen micro \) , i can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the zen micro was one of the more informed ones	1
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have n 't even gotten to all of them yet	1
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera	1
the headphones are n 't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity	2
will never purchase apex again	2
1 the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post processing flexibility	1
in short nokia themselves don 't know that this phone doesn 't work with the palm , and if you don 't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts , chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly	2
most of the other players i checked dont have user serviceable battery	1
user interface the software is simple and straight forward	1
i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful	2
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport	1
the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n 't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage	2
battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so	1
my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n 't have them	2
however , if there was one thing i liked about the creative , it would be the car adapter	1
even at the `` normal `` setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a `` digital ``	1
the phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display , long rundown time and a good software suite	1
solid food poop is very stinky and this diaper pail doesn 't really contain the smell	2
the problems i had installing norton extended way beyond what symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with	2
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n 't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk	1
i did not conduct a rigorous test , but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras , and the canon won hands down	1
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have	2
the sound is very nice	1
the grain was terrible	2
all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing creepiness of this very embarassing gift	2
after reading reviews of lcd problems , cracked , black blobs etc , i figured that it was probably a very limited problem	2
the camera is adequate and if i want high res photos i 'll use my digital camera instead	1
first 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor	1
creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and , yes , charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie	1
i like this router a whole lot better the linksys 11b router it replaced the signal strength seems ot be much strainers , seldom falling below the `` very good `` range \( and most often excellent within 25 50 feet of the router	1
however since this router is backward compatible , that doesn 't pose a problem at all	1
everything else about the camera is great	1
i 've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views	1
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email	1
5 \) video recorder is of no use and one can not record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the `` free picture and video messaging `` offered by service provider	2
it also holds a lot more diapers	1
there are 2 things that need fixing first is the battery life it will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons	2
the service from t mobile is very good too	1
this one has a color display , which i like a lot , being very visual	1
the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function	2
1 \) the champ is easy to use	1
not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it	2
the instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep	1
gets nice sound too	1
i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation	1
nice little phone light compact	1
feels solid in hand	1
it 's easy	1
high quality video and pictures rock !	1
unless you have an enormous music audio book library , the 20 gb model should have more than adequate storage capacity , with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs	1
i use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty	1
cuts are easy and smooth	1
i think this is it 's biggest flaw	2
absolutely no problems with this router	1
first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds	2
its quiet	2
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him	1
this router works at 54mbps that 's megabyte not kilobyte	1
i was a little disappointed in the low end	2
the phone 's sound quality is great \( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud \) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing	1
poor visibility on the keys	2
the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call	2
overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it	1
the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !	1
not counting the time i spent editing the songs \( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc \) the transfer was pretty painless	1
this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me , which is great considering i 'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting	1
my old sony ericsson t610 has this feature	2
this holds alot and does not take up alot of space	1
i 've been bothered by blown out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better	2
the main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients	1
i gave up and got a diaper decor	2
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light	1
the battery issue is superficially a concern , but any reasonable solder jockey \( such as myself \) can pop in a new one when the time comes \( based upon the plentiful info gained from a go ogle for 'ipod battery replacement ' \)	2
one of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to windows media player	1
as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine	1
in the hands of someone who does n 't , it will yield good results on idiot program auto mode	1
the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m12v than it was on my old router	1
this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price	1
i bought the player this week and i like it by far	1
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference	1
\) can 't be left in the car it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long	2
creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean	1
i downloaded and updated the firmware , and followed the easy setup instructions	1
it is lightweight , sleek and attractive	1
some features that the 'zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include a 5g hard drive actually an sd flash card drive very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook 's calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours \( i can change the battery myself for about 40 to buy vs	1
you need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network	1
it would just spin up and stop , and display `` no disc ``	2
what impressed me most was the sound	1
the ipod is a very nice product , which given reasonable care , should give a lot of service	1
this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared	2
there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board	2
also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and br mp3 cds \( my old apex ad 1200 had trouble with these \)	1
not plug play relies on id3 no fm or recording	2
i can use it as a modem for my computer , connect with clients and friends , the possibilities are endless	1
so the pretty solid router all around good for the money here 's the link to firmware updates http www suavest com forum6 html	1
lastly , the price is fantastic	1
another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty 500 price tag and get a quality camera	1
3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust	2
4 \) buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging	2
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use	1
it still smelled	2
but you can download some really good ones like pac man or mafia wars	1
i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the `` sliding wrench `` which comes on the router	2
it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it	2
sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features	1
it works better and has more useful features than nis 2003	1
yes , you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle , but then it is gone	2
smaller size , 1 gb of more space , radio , voice recording , removable battery , cooler look , all in one	1
the disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures , especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can	2
it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 of the quality that you would from a true line out jack	2
what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical	2
this one has a good looking	1
for a specific location , i still think its a great phone	1
i had never liked the idea of the diaper genie because of the refills	2
the scroll bar again takes some getting used to	2
the `` scene `` mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a `` regular `` setting	1
the only main drawback is the fact that the voice dialing system is kinda picky	2
negatives of the player itself you need to do a little work before having full enjoyment of this player	2
it is a nice router in all ways but one	1
it came with a good fence that is simple yet precise and thats well made and won 't break	1
i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players \( from friends season 2 \)	2
while i 'm not too keen on their customer service \( none of the products i have from creative have given me issues \) , i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth	1
as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better	1
i don 't know , maybe i got a defective one but first , the player would not shut off , next , the player would not come on i had to send it away to get repaired	2
best phone i 've ever owned , period	1
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use	1
the best thing to do with this version , is to leave it on the store shelf it doesn 't work , and will cost you an enormous amount of your time , not to mention your hard earned dollars	2
it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation	2
it plays just about any format \( check before you buy if it plays yours \)	1
i love the bluetooth easy to use with a wireless abra headset	1
it did play a dvd r which was unplayable in my older philips machine	1
about the product the zen micro is a sleek , stylish device that caters not just to `` hip `` youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life , size , or the `` awkward `` factor	1
for one thing , the diapers always get jammed in it	2
12 \) big storage my entire cd collection in one small device \( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting \) !	1
all in all , i believe this is arguably the best non slr digital camera on the market	1
it 's not my first choice in cameras ,	2
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small	1
battery compared to the other players on the market , the ipod has one of the worst batteries around	2
this really is a great little phone its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !	1
i love all of the features , and presets as well	1
the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said	2
the screen is quite big \( between all hand phone \) , but the just about 65000 color	1
do n 't buy this player	2
in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device only buy the capacity you need for your music collection \( see point 1 for some sizing information \)	2
my experience with installation was quite good	1
\) creative , inc the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box , then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on every single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices	2
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly	1
the first thing i did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for wmp10 , it syncs flawlessly with media player and transfers are fast	1
size extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you	1
it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design	1
the first one we installed did n 't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least	2
this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n 't purchase it	2
the router works fine for both wired and wireless	1
the picture quality of this camera is outstanding \( taking its ' size and price into consideration \)	1
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work	2
has a great helpline	1
i 'm probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software	2
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t mobile	2
there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !	1
finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600	2
i 've had it for about a week now and have to say it 's one of the best purchases i 've ever made	1
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it	1
the eax sound enhancement feature did n 't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq	2
by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do	1
and for those that are int rested the recharger works anywhere in the world \( and is quite small \)	1
they look fantastic	1
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into	1
but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !	1
as one other reviewer pointed out , it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the `` plunger `` to get the diapers in the pail , even though upon inspection the bag doesn 't really look full	2
his is what i get for my 200 on this mp3 player \?	2
one complaint the screen is too easily scratched !	2
i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use \( hardware and software \) , playback quality and value for the price	1
its not a perfect system but its a very good one	1
on occasion i 'm not able to connect to the phone with isync via bluetooth but i found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem	2
when you look through the viewfinder \( not the lcd \) the bottom left corner of the picture \( about 15 \) is blocked by the lens	2
overall it is a great unit hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it	1
the picture rs are amazing	1
the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom	1
so loud , really , that it does n 't work terribly well as a silent ringer option	2
i like some local stations , stern , and npr , and so the radio seemed like a great option	1
this program would not let me send outlook email or listen to audible sample books online	2
fm transmitter \( belkin has a good one \) to use zen with your car stereo fm tuner latest find connected this baby to my 3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to ipod	1
i was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work , to no avail	2
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer \( and vice verse \) was easy too	1
of course , if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay 30 per incident	2
that 's it for now , what are you doing still reading this , click the `` add to cart `` button already !	1
aside from a 6mb built in phone memory , there 's a 32mb mmc card that goes with it !	1
i must say , i think this is the coolest camera i 've ever owned !	1
this is the first cell phone i 've owned , and overall , i am quite pleased with it	1
it really is a great buy if you are loo kin at having just one modem but many computers around the house	1
i 've been incredibly happy with this camera	1
it does n 't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive	1
11 \) minimal pause between songs less than that on other devices good achievement for a hard drive based player	1
the plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing	1
the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !	2
first off , the battery	2
i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd rs dvds	1
purchased the ad 2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it	2
i 've got a buddy who 's trying to offload his almost new 300 systematic because he saw what this router can do	1
screen was good , easy to read	1
it sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all \( and we live in the damp and humid south , where odors of all kinds are generally rife \)	1
the 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of the states and not as well in more remote areas	2
five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums	1
yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order \( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out \) it actually turns out to be really handy	1
there are extra features packed inside this unit \( some that most will hardly ever use \) such as fm radio tuner , voice recorder , calendar , and alarm clock	1
i have not yet used all the features , like the calendar , etc , but as a music player this little thing rocks	1
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money	1
i got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags	1
now , the player 's ear phone jack is not working i have to send it away again	2
removable and cheap battery a li battery usually works properly for 1 3 years	1
opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it	2
i was worried about what the sound quality would be like , but that seems to be just as good as the actual cd sound	1
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it	1
if i could , i 'd trade up on my creative muvo2 and snag a zen micro tomorrow	1
as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !	2
that is , you can not access the internet at all	2
the movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160x120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640x480	2
it contains the smell from our baby 's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside	1
all the good reviews for the sd500 are true	1
i am a big fan of itunes , simply because it is terribly fast and convenient if you are buying the songs from the itunes site	1
i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n 't work !	2
the player looks great , feels great , and sounds great	1
especially the bluetooth server meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again	2
the zen micro is near perfect	1
no voice activated dialing \( what were they thinking	2
the back of the player is nice too , with water ripples inside the clear white coating	1
i 'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops i jumped through \( emails , downloads , reboots , a purge and another download , plus reading through the help menu \) a refund should be twice as frustrating	2
it has a nice color screen	1
i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for	2
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine	1
i am very pleased so far	1
after 4 attempted installs , i have finally given up	2
6 \) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed	2
it works great	1
the software failed repeatedly	2
what a junk	2
included creative software is pretty poor	2
it looks great and is loaded with features	1
does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library	2
the battery life is not that of the casio 's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opinion with the battery life you 've got	1
the touch controls took a little getting used to but now i wouldn 't change it for the scroll wheel	2
the menus are easy to scroll through they are laid out naturally , and make sense	1
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints	1
this is somewhat annoying , but from working with computers \( especially windows ugh \)	2
overall , i 've been very impressed with the player	1
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot	1
i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards	1
the product also leaves a faint smell in the room	2
the two times optical zoom operates smoothly and quietly , and lo and behold , a two piece shutter like cap automatically slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off	1
buttons do seem a little sticky tho and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem	2
i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession great for action shots	1
i have to move pictures off of it every day so i have room for more pictures the next , and i don 't have enough money to buy the 256 meg card that i 've had my eye on for a while	2
the unit is easy to use and intuitive	1
the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's `` notmad `` software because of some advanced features i wanted	1
its just as fast as the included creative software , but much less invasive , and overall better looking	1
with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great	1
this is my first digital camera and i could n 't be happier	1
the setup and transfer process was cake for me	1
the manual is excellent	1
i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and , very importantly , the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous	1
really easy to use	1
i am giving a zero star to symantec for this version !	2
cons no am fm radio tuner something a large number of compete tors are doing	2
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !	1
it fits into a hand well , it has a removable battery \( this is important \) , great sound quality , fm stereo , recorder , smooth ui , and a feature that most uni pods lack char !	1
the flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to	2
bluetooth does not work on this phone	2
i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy	1
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic \?	1
my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices , but they also don 't last as long	2
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player	1
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone	1
2 \) phone is awfully slow	2
if it weren 't so big i would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers	2
i really liked the price	1
perfect size ! beats the competition by leaps and bounds	1
3 it never smelled at all	1
moreover , apart from the plastic cable cover , the camera has a nice , solid feel about it , and it 's so tiny , i take it with me wherever i go	1
hate to wait between shots	1
overall i 'm incredibly impressed with my new zen touch	1
when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off	1
the click wheel is incredibly convenient , however it can be a little overly touchy at times , which will make you frustrated with your own fingers	1
of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents	1
all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n 't done it since	2
protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window	2
it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files	1
comes with a installation cd which instructs you step by step to setting up the router	1
it 's a great looking , easy to use device but it 's the sound quality which is truly amazing far better than my sony mini disc player	1
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality	2
otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward	2
with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod	1
as a computer , or pda its weak since the screen , while large by phone standards , is still tiny to really do anything on	2
moving on to sound department it delivers !	1
video output stopped working	2
b \) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger printed the len a few times , and au lens ti gt and cause potential damage	2
the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones	2
i read many reviews on norton i s 2004 from a variety of sources \( cnet , amazon , message boards \) and came to the conclusion that nis 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update	2
this is a good deal for music and data storage	1
the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb	2
the bags attach inside the champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle	1
the good small size durable seeming metal case easy to use visually distinctive good picture quality fast usb connection mostly intuitive operation really cool photostitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas	1
anyhow , this software is working fine and no problems since i installed it two weeks ago	1
and the slim form factor together with the mirror like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !	1
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software \( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth \)	1
regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop	2
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !	1
got way too many blurry pictures	2
i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust	2
i highly recommend this !	1
this is a well made and powerful tool	1
silverfish color really adds a special touch	1
which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in midi format for free on the net	1
while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability	1
so i took out the battery and put it back in again , only to find that it would not work	2
for more than a year , and it is totally reliable	1
both are very easy to learn use , and intuitive enough for even a novice	1
3 band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider	1
in addition , i do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours , and it can take four hours for a full charge	2
i give it 4 stars only because the installation process or rather problems that may surface during the installation process can be frustrating to the average computer user	2
second , the setup cd actually worked perfectly	1
i work on word , explorer , netscape , acrobat reader , photoshop at same time \( meaning using a lot of memory \) , but still dont see a problem with computer \( getting slow or crashing \)	1
it feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon	1
this did n 't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size	1
the included earphones are pretty good my advice \?	1
it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to	1
then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all	2
there are some highs to the 2004 edition , but mostly lows	2
i 'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its li ion battery , the better firmware , or a combination of both factors	1
great sound , very long battery life \( i routinely play it for 12 hours \) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price	1
my op ion is concentrate on what you need now , this product has excellent range , holds a teddy connection , ha sent even drooped one and i have it for more than a month now	1
so far i have used all of the above mentioned features , and find them well designed , and easy to understand	1
it 's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in europe are quite reasonable	1
it was easy to assemble , and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion	1
the blue backlight is pretty cool	1
original review december 2004 i 'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their zen micro , but mine has worked great !	1
the phone book is very user friendly and the speakerphone is excellent	1
only used for 3 month before it 's down !	2
i like it 's shape and it 's keypad and joystick	1
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones	1
feature wise , its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there	1
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset	1
however , the creative software is not real intuitive	2
we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd500	1
on the t mobile service i was able to take pics as we drove across i 70 and email them to family friends once we reached a t mobile tone \( usually a major city \)	1
it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n 't be played on my old 200 sharp player !	1
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it	1
typically , the problem is the headphone jack it was for me and many others	2
creative are the sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static	2
by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money if you are undecided , the creative zen micro seems to be the best choice	1
essentially , the cd included with the package is , for the most part , worthless	2
there is no photo viewing option , however , there is a 20 gb photo ipod , but it costs 20 more	2
then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not	2
first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed	2
the included software removes any red eye easily	1
because it can help a so so photographer take spectacular photos !	1
i take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice	1
it 's so small	1
the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest	2
oh , and another is the cool `` halo `` light that surrounds the touch pad , and light 's up when you touch the screen , and how the light glows when the zen is connected to the computer	1
the pics can be touched up in photoshop , and be printed at 4x6 and they look great !	1
easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumb wheel scroll push button	1
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus	1
also , the battery 's aren 't user replaceable	2
just want a wireless router for home or your very small business , you can just get a wrt54g from here and configure it	1
but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing great battery saver	1
where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable \( and they included a second one free \)	2
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc	1
this is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment	2
if you want to purchase a real case or container or clip on carrier for you zen micro , expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time	2
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain	1
actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated	1
the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods	1
the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly	1
now i know why they are pieces of junk	2
i 'm an advocate of nokia , but this phone and the following models \( 7610 \) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone	2
everything i wanted ! the apple ipod has become one of the most sought after electronic gadgets and for good reason	1
even though i never ventured into the cloth land , i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life !	1
overall , i am very pleased with it	1
as i drove across the country i lost reception only in eastern kentucky 's mountains	1
the battery life on this phone is surreal	1
all that said , i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera	2
8 buttons are little , but if you have steady fingers and deal ed with a casio worst calculator watch , you can deal with almost anything	2
we can start by losing the shiny miracle material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong , and thus eliminate the need for third party `` asking `` protective covers for an extra thirty bucks	2
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low	2
i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds , no big deal	1
all in all , this is another excellent creative product	1
excellent diaper disposal unit	1
remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons	2
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used	1
i spent hours setting up the stations \( accepts about 13 14 , i believe \) , though the reception is unpredictable	2
this phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones	1
\) the zen micro appears sturdy and well constructed , hefty , if you will , far better than many of its competitors	1
navigation system the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs	2
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price	1
so so 1 customer service 6 calls half were efficient other half were equally incompetent	2
it has many great features and very few bad ones	1
there 's even an equalizer \( under `` settings `` \) that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic , bass booster , bass reducer , classical , dance , `` deep `` , and electronic	1
a lot of `` fragments `` were left in the registry , and it the norton system folders	2
the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight	1
fact is , it could n 't be easier to use	1
in noisy environment , it 's hard to hear from the earpiece	2
deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd party earphones \( 20 \) and software \( 25 \)	2
with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots	1
the top did not fit well into the unit \( felt defective \)	2
00 good though , and the zen does have a few drawbacks	2
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones	1
the player itself has all sorts of problems	2
i thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time	2
i am enjoying my phone a lot	1
handsfree future is good , but not too exciting	1
third , the poor design continues with the case	2
also if you do manage to get it installed , any problems with liveupdate or with system works will also affect the functionality and or the process of updating internet security	2
and so far , i have been very , very happy with my zen micro	1
this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my counter top and also to listen to my old 8 track records	1
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun	1
i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit	1
also , it takes any kitchen sized trash bag , so there is no special bag to stock	1
these issues aside , the ipod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one , you can 't be without one	1
so , right out of the box i had issue	2
the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless	2
and with usb 2 0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy	1
creative has excellent music software , a very responsive tech support group \( they are quick on firmware updates , and make them publicly available \) , and usually a good array of accessories	1
i had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the norton firewall vs the windows firewall , and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because i did not have a `` customer priority id number ``	2
but the earbuds suck !	2
progressive scan player for a relatively low price \( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower priced progressive scan players as well \)	1
its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket	2
i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players	1
while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time , my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than linksys	1
i absolutely love it	1
yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion \( i do n 't like it too but no harm done since i always use the cam ea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get \) in the viewfinder when you do n 't zoom \( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away \) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon that is what lamest exactly ot the picture	2
i could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days !	2
it is a multifunction phone , reception quality is better than the 610	1
the software has n 't been a hassle for me at all	1
pc software that comes with the player is not as simple as i tunes but its not bad at all	2
i 'm really happy with this purchase	1
the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds	2
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under 1200	1
i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t zones never worked	2
there is no fm tuner , while there is no fm tuner on the creative zen \( on the micro version of the zen there is a tuner \) , the iriver h10 20gb , the rio karma , and the audio x5 have fm tuners	2
p s the only snag i encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the micro to a front usb port the bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power after connecting it to the rear ports , it works perfectly	2
even after all the nightmare sound problems , i 'd still half way like this product if it kept it 's promise the ability to store 1500 songs	2
t mobile is trying very hard , and again they do have pretty good csr 's	1
remember , this phone uses an operating system symbian and it 's feature rich w 65k colors	1
it took several days of attempts before things finally `` worked `` again and i have n 't a clue why	2
just follow the instructions carefully , it 's all based on a cd that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time	1
can recommend the hitachi in this ergonomic arena at the price quoted on amazon it is a bargain	1
however , the battery life isn 't as good as i would like	2
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use	1
track , name , artist , album and genre is automatically retrieved via internet labeled , and properly categorized into the zen	1
the range is terrific , i am using this for my home and i was transferring at 50 mbs from my backyard	1
the achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music , or copy large files over the local network	2
the only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming	2
e \) the case is too small it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	2
3 the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture	2
the face plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so	2
the interface took a little getting used to	2
it is crystal clear	1
the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect	2
5 check traffic411 com for la traffic on the 405	1
anyhow some demerits of this phone , the phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most nokia variants	2
controls are a bit awkward	2
the reception and sound quality are top notch	1
battery life is ok	1
i must add to the dismay delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held	1
great features	1
speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifices the battery life	2
the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected	2
a very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years	1
but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture	2
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call	1
i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision	1
value comparing data storage with price	1
for example , i tried playing my new `` pirates of the caribbean `` extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it	2
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy	1
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned	1
i 'd give it 5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes	2
the price compared to the ipod is great	1
the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot , and with instant review on the lcd screen , you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot	1
the phone can use any midi audio file as a ringtone	1
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay 300 for this great player	1
the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case	2
i have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant sharper	1
exposure compensation in 1 3 stop increments \( i leave it set on 1 3 stop to brighten up the default exposure , which goes a bit dark for my taste \)	1
but that is good for me because symantec soft wares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers	1
sound quality \? phenomenal	1
bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent	1
the size is tiny , which i love	1
anyway , my wife got this for me for my birthday and i love the thing	1
it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep	1
accessing files by artist and album \( i mostly look things up by artist \) is easy and intuitive	1
while i had the phone , the positive features were good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece	1
i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !	1
the phone offers a 32 mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature	1
i have about 6 gb used on my ipod so far \( well over 1000 songs \) , and as far as i can tell , all of them play at near cd quality	1
the only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust	2
7 have a good chunk of my small mp3 to listen through the speaker phone	1
the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for \( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! \)	2
the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name	2
not a killer problem , but not well done , either	2
apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy	2
i find the apex ad 2600 to be a great buy	1
i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all	2
i had a lot of problems setting it up , since the software given along with it is buggy	2
for last one month my rebate status showing me that my rebate is approved and check is delivered but still i am waiting for check	2
1 your hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism	2
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen	1
4 the zen stores data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk \( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched \)	2
you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll	2
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a hard drive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing	1
the pictures are razor sharp , even in macro	1
i 've often struggled to get something to work the way i want it , and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time !	2
the powershot g3 is a great camera	1
secondly , in addition to the lag each time you give a command , it 's just not that easily use able on the go	2
the biggest problem is the installation	2
2 despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax	2
multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you 'd expect	2
great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc	1
i had the second one for less than two weeks when i noticed a rattling humming buzzing sound while music was played	2
i installed , activated and registered nis 2004 without issue	1
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results	1
this is the mp3 player with everything i need as long as it lasts me a good three years , i 'm satisfied	1
the ease of use of the ipod is a major attribute	1
much cheaper than i pod good looking player \( beautiful blue back lit screen \) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n 't get damaged scratched fast transfer rate	1
after some research on the net , i discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current wrt54g design \( wrt54g , version 3 , which amazon currently sells \)	2
the sd500 rivals the canon g6 in image quality	1
the display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary	1
5 \) lack of good accessories this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing	2
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly	1
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera	1
the soft start is nice	1
it was a very quick setup and installation , in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up	1
digital zoom is clear too say you used all 3x optical zoom , try to do digital zoom then just try not to shake the camera at all and you 'll still get a clear good quality picture	1
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see	1
one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all	2
this camera is truely superb	1
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package	1
i have really enjoyed the camera on this phone	1
i am extremely satisfied with this camera	1
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi pro pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography	1
sound exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod	1
among my requirements for a phone were good screen , decent camera , bluetooth , and gprs support	1
this is my first mp3 player and i am so impressed with what such a small device can do	1
this simple nuance was too much for nokia , and they still refuse to acknowledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free	2
within one month , my player completely died	2
i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon	1
the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to get to	1
it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much	1
the lcd screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones	2
comments overall this is still a great value , but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market	1
i haven 't tried to set up any advanced features on the router , but it is not difficult to set up for basic use	1
in fact , i liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old , that i bought one for our new baby 's room	1
after attempting to navigate the clumsy touch pad system , i could not get the unit to download my wma files	2
the other controls are all very easy to use	1
some dvd 's i rented would not play	2
one cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem	1
huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you	1
i would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature	2
battery life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware requires a windows pc or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet awesome sound quality i mean it is creative right \?	1
the sound quality is excellent , accessing the music is easy , and the controls are generally well thought out	1
my son tried it and he too couldn 't change the speed without an assist	2
i built my own router table with a tilt up top made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob these two things make it easy to change out raise or lower the bits	2
if compact size is your highest priority in a 2 megapixel camera , the canon powershot s100 digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design	1
some adjustments in the settings could help make it better	2
overall , if you know what basic steps to take , it was not difficult to connect , and the s w worked well to connect	1
the plunge action isn 't smooth unless you make it so	2
it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc	2
it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set	1
playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists	1
my case doesnt close maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great	2
i 've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of skate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great !	1
it feels tiny in the hand without it	1
could be better to be a perfect camera \( and some competitors do some of this better \) purple fringing , details in high light area , noise over iso100 , red eyes , \( few \) processing artefact 's , \( few \) loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light , automatic autofocus , whizzing while video playback , better video compression \( smaller viedo files \) , more manual controls , longer lasting battery , indicator for battery , better protection of the lcd , less weight	1
its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily , not great from a cosmetic standpoint	2
always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped	2
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution	1
we have been using our diaper champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it	1
i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it	1
the zen micro \( mine 's black \) has a lot going for it	1
it has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside	1
fits well in hand in trouser pockets	1
also , multiple picture feature is very , very fast	1
also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection \( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 `` tv \)	2
for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player	1
with the ipod , you can also store documents and contact files \( from programs such as microsoft outlook \) when it 's connected to your pc as an external hard drive	1
the pictures are fabulous and their is a \( short \) learning curve to it there are tons of features i have n 't even gotten to	1
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring	2
they last about 1 1 2 years until the problems start	2
i have noted that as you use the tool , sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention	2
the buttons and interface are very easy to use	1
multimedia functions are enhanced by multi slide mms messages and a gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone	1
by the way , i use the norton 2003 corporate at work with absolutely no trouble	1
replacement battery is 50 compared to ipod 's 150	1
the earbuds are great headphones as good as my ak studio 240 , well not as good but darn close	1
the card basically installed itself and the `` install wizard `` on the cd that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer \( with the 54g card \) and also a second computer in my house \( with an 11b card \)	1
i hope you have a magnifying glass , because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny	2
well backlit keypad	1
they say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact	1
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones	1
reliability build i dropped the player once from about 4 ft , and it fell hard , but kept on playing	1
for the zen creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out , well presented and easy to open and put back together	1
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven sent	2
i particularly like the `` txt `` file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take	1
i added a crank for those times when i need to make fine adjustments , but i seldom use it	2
you hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of seconds to bring up the menu	2
5 excelent software package	1
then the most disappointing was trying to use viper raised panel bits that just barely fit , and i mean just barely	2
1 pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance	2
i 've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use	1
quite simply , the firmware and or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time	2
also , the fit and finish could be better although this doesn 't detract from performance	2
try before you buy if at all possible although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface	1
so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos	1
they take excellent macro shots as well	1
smooth plunging mechanism	1
this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues	2
they are a royal pain to install , and don 't function properly once finally installed if you can install them at all	2
the build quality shows why its so cheap small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n 't see on a sony and an overall plastic feel	2
another irrigation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on	2
what the hell is wrong with this thing	2
norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products , but with this one , they have fallen off the cliff	2
we just use the glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from target and they work wonderfully	1
it does n 't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n 't generally have firewire cards themselves	2
it can not be the computer or the owner , since i purchased mcgee anti virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems	1
works great ! ! ! !	1
i give this product five stars for its usability , performance , expandability , and definitely looks !	1
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter	1
also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore `` the `` when it lists the cds in alphabetical order	2
my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the dds service , the ripping process fails to populate the `` year `` field	2
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted	1
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it	1
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority , aperture priority , light metering adjustments , etc , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear	1
usb 2 0 very fast	1
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again	1
this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out	1
sometimes the pictures are on the dark side , but i 'm able to fix that using the photoshop 6 0 `` adjust levels `` function not sure how a person would do that without photoshop , though	2
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich	1
2 excellent picture quality and so simple to use ! ! !	1
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of	1
	2
luckily , with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing ! it is indeed worth nothing	1
fm tuner microphone having a tuner in the player is a blessing	1
the arm band is fantastic and it doesn 't budge even at the gym	1
no matter the format	1
the wizard is particularly sinister	2
the karma doesn 't look as sexy but it 's interface is very efficiently designed	2
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song playlist etc fast enough	1
after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed	1
and the video quality is amazing	1
you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on literally !	1
the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to	1
great quality picture and features	1
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization	1
screen review could be better	2
what an upgrade ! ! !	1
this phone is highly recommended otherwise	1
just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr like camera , its 4 megapixel and \( almost \) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance	1
the i pod is the best thing i have ever used	1
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches	1
i have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone	2
other than that , i think it is the best router for the money	1
as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale	2
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise	1
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order	1
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes	1
the headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use , and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony 's i 'd been having	2
the accessories that come with the player are great	1
the guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid	1
even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio	1
this linksys router does it for the right price	1
i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features extra 1g storage , wma support , replaceable battery , and especially that it wasn 't an apple product with their proprietary architecture	1
the tech support is worthless too	2
at first i had a problem with some smell , then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in then there is no smell at all !	1
after 57 pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings	2
initially , i was very impressed , after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this , i then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright	1
i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n 't nearly as good as t mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional	1
norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer	2
fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy the met 60 ct 4	1
i 've only had this camera for a few days , but it 's been great	1
i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets	1
i love that you don 't have to purchase expensive refills	1
the computer interface is 90 good , only losing points due to the fact that `` creative `` branding is all over the place within it	1
the memory \( 40 gb \) is staggering	1
i 've searched the program and their online tech support \( worthless \) and have found no solutions	2
configuring it for a home network was almost impossible	2
although the sound quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable mp 3 player to result in a good product	2
it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error	2
not only is it much more cost effective \( you can use regular trash bags rather than refills at 5 a pop \) , it is easier to use and clean , and has a larger capacity	1
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power	1
less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer	1
i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard	2
the extra spare battery is just a neat bonus	1
i did see the review here and other places about a cracked lcd screen	2
games not really important , but exist ant	1
flash as with all built in flashes in small cameras , you get over illuminated main subjects with depth being lost	2
i also removed the springs in the plunge tubes to make it easier to raise	2
the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons	2
it also does n 't have voice activated dialing big minus ! !	2
and it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old s30	1
other plusses changeable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod	1
it works great , i am usually at the full 54 mbps , although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is	1
a decent camera phone for taking quick pictures , movies , and having general all around fun with	1
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it	1
you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck	2
yes , the 1 800 number probably redirected me to someone in india , but the guy was easy to understand , and he helped solve the problem	1
6 the nikon coolpix line is a well established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model	1
yes , there is a belt clip , but that doesn 't hold the extra battery and usb cable	2
there are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router , and everybody is happy with it	1
you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone	1
i love my new nomad , its great !	1
the electronic speed control is not doing it 's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will	2
i had a casio unit , which had given great service , and would have been happy to get another one , but was tempted by the ipod 's sleek design , storage capacity , connection options firewire and usb , and its integration with itunes	1
in summary , i love this camera and would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range	1
the 4g ipod costs the same as this 5g zen micro	1
what makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has	1
because the `` engineers `` at creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack	2
the radio and voice recording are nice	1
t mobile was a pretty good server	1
nokia does not disappoint in this model	1
2 \) nice features , like web browser , camera , video recorder , speaker phone \( very usefully \) , clear voice reception	1
i ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because i change him so often downstairs	1
will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles \( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration \)	2
i 've had almost no problems with the firmware \( ie , lock ups , shut downs etc \) , but i have kept the player up to date	1
as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand	2
they are extremely convent and you don 't have to buy them seperately has i tunes , which provides quality music at low prices	1
while it didn 't have all the features i would have liked , it was better than anything else i could find at the time	1
the linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a mac	2
i have n 't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs	1
it sure does !	1
the package also comes with a usb cable , an ac adapter , a pair of headphones \( they 're okay until you get a better pair \) , a stand , and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in	1
the buttons are rather stiff	2
but i was ready to upgrade and when i discovered that canon was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher resolution , i had to have the s100	1
after telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program \( which i had already done \)	2
the box proudly displays `` securest \( tm \) `` `` wireless made simple `` `` one touch setup button `` `` easy start `` `` easy security `` `` easy everyday `` apparently linksys cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial	2
i 'm not gon na go into the features cause if you 're reading this review , you 've probably already looked at them , but i must say the dj feature if very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus !	1
i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the `` rigor `` of a business traveler	2
amazon is awesome !	1
the ipod is not overpriced compared to the market	1
	2
interface practically seamless	1
i love this pail !	1
and so far , i 've been very pleased	1
unfortunately , it does not give you the option of installing \( or installing \) them individually	2
it 's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though i haven 't had to do it yet of course	1
if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs	1
memory storage seemingly boundless	1
one drop from a pocket or desktop , and it 'd be a goner	2
4 the build is just right	1
the battery recharges raul fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice	1
i have an ipod and it is a great buy	1
fortunately for me , i have yet to have a single problem with this player	1
freebies you get a cradle with detachable stand and belt clip , some thing very handy and useful	1
and the tech writers have made the installation process so easy for people lick my aunt to follow	1
the price is incredible with the bonus pack and hitachi 's 25 incentive \( you need the code go to tool seeker com and it tells you \)	1
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox	1
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stop action photos contrary to what other reviewers experienced	1
i took it out one day and the lcd was not working	2
but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working	2
the headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of `` ear buds ``	2
at double speed \( 2x forward speed \) , it still plays mp3s with sound they are pitch corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !	1
this is a benefit for many reasons one being just for appearance , your pants wo n 't be bulging with this phone in your pocket	1
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to	1
and best of all , no wasting money on special refill bags this takes ordinary garbage bags !	1
i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended	2
the first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use	1
and supply those stupid white headphones	2
supporting an operating system , symbian os , you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone	1
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use	1
i decided to go with the diaper champ rather than the more popular diaper genie , because i didn 't like the idea of having to buy special bags	1
anted to rate the router higher than 1 star , due to its security , easy of use , etc	1
it it is a bit heavy for hand held work , but any router this size will be	2
linksys is more costlier than others and is a home consumer division of disco	2
really like it , easy to use , great images , very intuitive , fits in my jacket pocket	1
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times	2
this phone is not suitable for fast people , maybe only for old people	2
seems to work great	1
touch ups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct	1
i hooked the linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus kilobytes on the download e !	1
it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch \( greer ! \)	2
i find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can 't tightly bundle it without a mess , the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is outside of the diaper pail	2
so much packed in a small case and very affordable !	1
the photo quality is amazing	1
the installation software cd crashed repeatedly	2
having the digic ii chip helps a lot	1
unfortunately , creative offered scant few pages of instruction , which meant that i was on own from the outset	2
the more i use it and figure out how to do things , the more i like it	1
i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !	2
i found it intuitive to use \( i did n 't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes \)	1
white earbuds \( i replaced those with some shire headphones , big difference \) , a case , a stand , a clip \( which doesn 't really work \) , and a nice little zen micro bag	1
i never get dropped calls	1
like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound \( widely known to be better than ipod not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business \)	1
i downloaded a trial version of computer associates ex firewall and antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again	1
in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100	2
another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it	1
less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows `` no disc ``	2
the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera	2
for the price i think this is a remarkably fun mp3 player	1
for the person that uses the equipment every day , pay the extra and get a reliable safer unit	1
in general it is easy to use and well laid out	1
so , you might inquire , why don 't they make it a first priority to carefully , simply explain how download music from your music library to their device \? \? \? this seems academic to me	2
i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store 's sound system	1
they didn 't know what the problem could be	2
you can also slow a song down speed it up , which is cool too	1
the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to	2
for the price i don 't think you can beat it	1
very annoying	2
this phone has many other features , ir , just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial	1
it has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight	1
a huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it	1
the wrt54g offers excellent security features and much more \( and easier \) configuration menu that i didn 't even need a manual to setup correctly	1
and , other else , the camera is still vga	2
after two weeks the picture kept freezing	2
uploading music is quick and easy	1
it worked from 12 26 to 1 9 at which time the picture failed completely \( see other negative reviews my unit was n 't the only one this happened to \)	2
it is very simple to import via photo 2 and then move them to photoshop	1
long live apple , long live macs , and long live the ipod !	1
anti spam is good	1
my only complaint and the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on camera controls aren 't as intuitive as they should be	2
i really have no complaints over this unit	1
in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place	2
i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera , but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size	1
the fine adjustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table	2
audio is excellent	1
it fits in your pocket	1
using the software itunes is relatively simple , you just plug the usb cable in , wait your machine to detect the ipod and voila , any songs listed in your itunes library will be transfer ed on over to the ipod	1
it seems like the software is just not responding	2
there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc	1
simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point	1
also if you want a device that does so much more than the ipod mini but is at the same price , this is the player for you	1
the thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage , except the inevitable scratches	2
the battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use	2
i find it very stable and comfortable to use , it doesn 't jump around or make me feel like i need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control , and it has very good visibility to see your cut	1
the canon is very small , definitely pocket size , but still easy to hold firmly	1
it 's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router , activate the chuck lock , and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up	2
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work	2
speakerphone	1
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play	1
i still have my s70 because i like the wider lens sometimes , but in general , if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package , the sd500 is the only one you should buy	1
in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side mounted volume control	2
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping	1
this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers	1
the hitachi is made in malaya , and looked cheap compared with the makita , which is made in the usa	1
7 picture quality is excellent	1
the champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year	1
other than that this thing is great	1
you can 't do that with a sony t610 \( which i traded for a 6600 \)	2
the cut outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel	2
it is currently permanently mounted \( 3 years now \) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot	1
for the hobbiest , it 's probably a nice buy	1
finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !	1
as i wrote , this could have been a great product , but expect hidden charges \( read gross profiteering and price gouging \) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage	2
this is the best phone i have seen	1
this is ridiculous	2
ball metaphor i was hoping creative hit a home run here , and i think the zen micro is more like a stand up double	1
other than that it is all the same except the new updates	2
that 's a rare and valuable feature	1
if you have no previous version of nortron security on your system , or nortron antivirus , the installation will go fine , otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up ! the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation , even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly	2
neither message was answered \( they ask for 24 hours before replying i 've been waiting 27 days \)	2
this year , it seems that i choose my timing perfectly , having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro	1
the software is quick easy to use i found the entire process very easily mastered	1
it does take some getting used to	2
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand	1
this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has	1
as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible	1
sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products	1
the image quality is excellent	1
you do get 1 more gb than an ipod mini	1
i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player	1
it also has a stock tracking app built in \( also useless \) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics \( currency , length , area , etc \)	2
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there	1
a few of my work constituents owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality	1
other things that i miss are voice activated dialing and a standard 2 5 mm headset jack	2
unfortunately , this digital moment capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted	2
this is the best dvd player i 've purchased	1
the firmware has bugs too , so download and install the latest firmware from linksys	2
there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open \( my perv machine did it automatically \) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance	2
after several years of torture in the hands of at t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family phones from at t to t mobile !	2
however , i do n 't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n 't secure and the case can slip off	2
both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together	1
the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an `` auto `` mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use	1
the software with the ipod includes itunes , which allows you to play the music on your computer , rip cds onto your computer , and move your music from the computer to the ipod	1
in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it	2
back in may 2004 , when i first reviewed this , it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run	2
compatibility with other devices is excellent too i 've only found one 11b device that won 't work with its mixed mode \( and it won 't work with anyone 's mixed mode \)	1
creative labs customer support website is useless	2
3 4 way through the first disk we played on it \( naturally on 31 days after purchase \) the dvd player froze	2
in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned	1
the documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router i needed a lot of help from linksys technical assistance to set that one up	1
i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose	2
and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control	2
this is only a problem at night , during the day the screen is very easy to see	2
i use it on a router table , and it is works well	1
to set up the box , wap , and ether nest bridge , with the encryption on was less then 30 mins	1
there is no comparison , the champ is easy and smell free , the genie was difficult to use one handed \( which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad \) and there was a def finite odor emanating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn 't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ	1
i tried to contact apex to return it \( i missed the amazon return period \) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept	2
overall , it does its basic function very well , but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occasion	2
i 've taken about hundred shot with the canon , in varying lighting situations , all in auto mode , and not one blurry picture ! ! !	1
technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !	1
the battery on mine lasts 2 days if i don 't play games that much , and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat	1
the radio feature has superb sound quality	1
second , the `` automatic `` sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer	1
i have a canon a 70 , and now this sd500 , its amazing , how this little camera produces , such great pics , it even brings out ur pimples on the face	1
wish i could give it 4 1 2 stars	1
it 's the same body as the popular elp2 aps camera \( take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you 'll have an idea of the front profile ! \)	1
but the major problem i had was with the software	2
my first impression was positive	1
enjoy	1
4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worth wile at the price	1
for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some	1
unlike other reviewers , i like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table	1
considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player	1
but it wouldn 't let me turn the av protection back on and it wouldn 't stop with the alerts	2
i tried to call norton , and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for non tech customer service \( tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of muzak \) or they have a 30 tech support number	2
unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd	2
this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before	2
the ! sound quality is great	1
i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase	1
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 \( in conjunction with my professional flash system \) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits	1
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n 't blind you when you stare too long	1
i did it and it was worse the second time around unbelievable	2
4 the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking	1
i use a nokia 6600 , it has a great color tft display and camera equipped with zoom , which complement a built in video recorder with audio and a real one player for playback and streaming of 3gpp compatible and real media video clips	1
its ability to record radio is useful as well , but would have been more so if it could be preset	1
can 't get easier than that !	2
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they \( most of them \) try hard to answer your questions	1
have had the nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with t mobile	1
they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply	2
when i hooked it up it only produced sound a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio no picture !	2
the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n 't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there	1
second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed	2
it looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black	1
the camera is a dream to operate in auto mode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes	1
does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers \( car radio \)	2
they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same sounding name \( and they are long \)	2
battery life keeps improving on the ipod , and a new ipod will give you up to twelve hours of play time , per charge	1
they are not wow able good	2
i received this little jewel as a gift and i can honestly say absolutely love it	1
the touch pad is over sensitive , and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive	2
what i like the most small and solid feel	1
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2 0	1
it has great incredibility	1
i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes no crashes or problems	1
negative impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button	2
the only free help you get is in renewing your subscription !	1
i have read the installation instructions for both nis 2004 and navy 2004 prior to installation , but still ended up with the same result junk software	2
the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price	2
this is an excellent router for the money	1
the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n 't figure out a way to break it	2
i would recommend this camera unequivocally !	1
with 40gb of storage i have about 7 , 500 songs on the player \( everything music file i have is on there \) with room for about 2 , 500 more	1
way to go apple !	1
the only downside i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react , meaning when i push the contacts button , it takes a while to load , this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone	2
some features in the user interface	2
no line out jack as i said , there is none	2
personally , i may never buy symantect products again	2
battery life is good for a phone of this size	1
software the software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it , it does the job well	2
it 'll make life a lot easier , and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review	1
1 \) frame freezes and the family yells , `` dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! ``	2
the touchpad is annoying sometimes \( give me the click wheel and pres sable buttons any day \) , but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying	2
this was obviously a conspiracy as it is freak in ' easy to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries ! !	2
2 battery life is over 4 5 hours , compared to about 2 5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikon 's	1
then , my ad pop up blocking was completely gone	2
the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do	2
i was having intermittent problems with it losing connection	2
i am so pleased with this product ! ! !	1
the battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser	2
had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches	2
it 's far better than all others on the market	1
they are sensitive and accurate \( perhaps too accurate , it senses through t shirt cloth , but the touchpad can be locked \) , but easy to clean , unlike buttons	1
i am just in love with this phone , especially after using a more primitive phone about 3 years	1
very cool features great camera with zoom cool quality pictures great ringtones bluetooth feature is great	1
after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures	1
great price	1
navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone	1
another plus in my book , no file limits !	1
and amazon com has it for such a great price how can you go wrong \?	1
8 connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company von at 56k speed via bluetooth	1
i 've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it	1
i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n 't do it !	2
the panorama modes are wonderful	1
i did like the heft of the machine	1
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www crazy cellphone com	1
if you haven 't noticed , they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self timer	1
if you think you are saving 40 getting the hitachi , you are right , and you are also getting a router worth 40 less than a makita	2
the phones are awesome	1
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included	2
and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained , which the diaper genie never did !	1
the menus are very easy to navigate	1
the remote is a little hard to understand	2
it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone \( which i have to say is probably my favorite function \) and downloadable java apps	1
overall small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !	1
4 \) usb 2 0 means fast data transfers \( 1 song sec ! \)	1
the nokia 6600 is a great phone , good games , good camera	1
also included in the `` games `` section is the great music trivia option which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs	1
creative media source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it , and the file transfers are fast	1
another problem is that the latest 2 0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very , very slow for downloads charging 2	2
also , the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable \( although my wife didn 't have a problem \) , so i bought a pair of over the ear headphones	2
i 've owned many norton products in my time , and for the most part , i 've been pleased with their performance	1
as it turns out , this is an awesome camera !	1
basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n 't used	1
both the on off switch \( soft start \) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand	1
i love the rounded edges now , fits so much better in a pocket , jeans or suit	1
retraction said mine had silver plate it does have display	1
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it	1
even viewed cds full of jogs	1
i tried it again this morning and it said i didn 't have the required `` permissions `` and lacked proper administrator status	2
so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine	1
after installation , the very first time i booted up the creative mediasource organizer , intending to use its cd burning and ripping functions , it totally shorted out	2
3 \) the champ is odor free for at least 15 months	1
finding all the albums , songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig \( well 18 gig \) worth of music	1
however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once	2
i 've used the corporate edition at work without any problems ever	1
3 \) the joystick design they are using on the new nokias gives you a great degree of control	1
in any case , navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders	2
loved the slim design	1
the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged	2
the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint	2
they obviously have quality and reliability problems	2
dependability i 've seen no glitches	1
my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems	1
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient	2
as opposed to the nomad ii or any other flash based player , the songs load extremely fast about one or two seconds per song	1
the only thing i don 't like is the small size \( 8 meg \) memory card that comes with it	2
with the champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid	1
i have to say that i am very happy with it so far	1
the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch	2
after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn 't do anything but turn on my player	2
a couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet	2
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists \) it does n 't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music creative or any other company all my 12 5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags hooray !	1
the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds	1
other mp3 players won 't give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level , so i imagine they won 't at lower ones , either	1
it doesn 't bog down under load	1
easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot	1
basically the 6600 is a bundle of over hyped features you don 't and won 't need \( if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc \) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average	2
the radio works excellent in my area , i 'm not sure everywhere else	1
the pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect	1
the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise	1
styling ergonomics the keys are small , which generally doesn 't bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little 'braille , ' but the keys run into each other , so careful attn must be paid when dialing	2
travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket	1
you have the option to have the flash automatic or off	1
two it has a removeable rechargeable battery , so you don 't have to send the thing in when the re !	1
diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don 't tightly wrap them first	2
unfortunately it turns out to be the `` disposable `` type	2
im a more happier person after discovering the i p button !	1
so for the money it costs for one of those top of the line models i 've got a good router a nice table to put it in i like that	1
i love having the option to manually control the f stop , shutter speed and even focus	1
i have no complaints with this mp3 player	1
i still give the ipod five stars , though , as it could have been something i did incorrectly during the install \( though i did follow the onscreen prompts \) so i 'll give apple the benefit of the doubt	1
i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic	1
the battery is replaceable \( a real plus \) and there is a leather case \( another real plus \)	1
it ain 't cutting edge \( no pun intended \) state of the art with all the latest bells whistles it definitely ain 't pretty	2
it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried	1
it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented	1
imagine my disappointment , though , when the zen micro proved able to play only the mega strongest fm signals in my area	2
however , symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release	2
the cover that came with it did n 't fit very well	2
the player hangs up on file transfer every once in a while , prompting a reset	2
\) one outstanding positive feature is the battery it holds a charge for a long time , longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup	1
it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor !	1
i recently bought the linksys wrt54g router and have been very happy with the router itself	1
many of these programs are shareware , some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks	1
the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it \( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd r \) i have read other reviews and some good and so om not so good , but my feeling at this time is `` two thumbs up `` !	1
the auto mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n 't played with it too much on manual	1
it 's a very intuitive program	1
well , within 45 days the video output quit working \( both rca optic \)	2
while this phone obviously doesn 't have the same quality construction as motorola does , the nokia 6600 is one of the better phones i 've used	1
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible	2
2 it can be operated with one hand leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table	1
nokia was my first non flip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them	1
it holds plenty of songs	1
a digic ii powered image processing system enables the sd500 to snap a limitless stream of 7 megapixel photos at a respectable clip , its start up time is tops in its class , and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition	1
also , with one click you can help train your spam killer	1
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players	1
the auto focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes they are dummy proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera	1
you 'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once	2
overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase	1
i am very pleased with my purchase	1
the internet connection would go down every 5 mins when i used it with a p2p program called bit spirit	2
i will never use all the `` whistles and bells `` this machine is capable of	1
i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips , i give it 5 5 stars \) oh and btw , while you take video clips , you can zoom it too ! \( digital zoom only though \) but still \( my old one can 't do that you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip \)	1
overall , i highly recommend this phone	1
the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks	2
also the battery life isn 't great but it 's sufficient for my needs	2
for the money , i 'm not sure you can do better	1
the metal housing seems very rugged	1
sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweaking with settings to try to make it great	1
i already knew something was wrong , because much of the spam i 've seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products	2
update \( march 2005 \) my son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now , but the diaper champ hung in there till the very end easy to use , no problems with odors , and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby \)	1
the blue backlit lcd looks really neat and is easy to read	1
it comes with a good case that fits it snugly	1
images taken indoor were n 't so clear	2
it 's not as stylized as a sony or samsung	2
the macro mode works well , although it takes some practice since the camera doesn 't clearly indicate when it can 't focus	1
6 \) the phone is really wide , which seems to be a turnoff for many people , but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic	1
3 it is slow , if you keep the original configuration and prigs \( why 'd u buy it then \? ! \) it 'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured screen nokias	2
since zen does not have an external antenna it has some problems catching weak signals but it works	2
the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad	1
when you consider expandability \( downloads via computer \) , the numerous features , two transmission programs and multiple storage devices , dependability this is a phone that isn 't easy to out grow	2
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy	1
i have set up it 's pda features with avaunt com where you can download info from sites like weather , map quest maps directions into it , which is great	1
it 's worth it	1
it wo n 't play 80 of my movies , which are all store bough ten	2
everything that i have listed above , the zen has , and more	1
the vibration is not top	2
it is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it	2
now in october , 2004 , the firewall said i couldn 't ok anymore software to use the internet because its full	2
unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed	2
it 's a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus	2
otherwise , this player is awesome !	1
first , the cons a tad bulky not the most aesthetic looking player and does n 't support a folder structure	2
i see many other reviews that say the same stay away from norton , they don 't deserve you , or anyone !	2
respectable , solid , but not awe inspiring	2
it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want	2
bottom line is that at 160 , this is an absolute steal	1
i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift	1
setup is totally breeze and linksys 's web site is pretty easy to navigate	1
the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n 't notice after first day	2
another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the usb cable	1
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !	1
to eliminate any smells we simple stuck a stick up room deodorizer inside the lid	2
pros the design is very nice , and the colors are too	1
usb 2 0 transfer is insanely fast	1
all in all , this product is definitely one i would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price	1
the pictures are tack sharp , colors are vivid , and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire	1
the auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds	2
i was looking for a phone which synced with mac osx using bluetooth , had decent battery life , could check email , had good reception , nice screen size and was durable \( i break often break small gadgets \)	1
have tried to contact apex via e mail \( customerservice apexdigital com \) , but the e mail address is not valid	2
it had a heavier and more sturdy casing	2
stay away from this product !	2
who wants to pay 30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost 95 \? \( i also bought the back up cd \)	2
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player	1
nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have	1
i registered for this item because of the good reviews it got , however i was not impressed	2
best in class sound	1
the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with	2
the sound quality is very good	1
i tried called apex cu st service , no help	2
i love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it	1
it 's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn 't have clumsy and confusing \( not to mention expensive \) refills	1
however , this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes	1
almost from the beginning , liveupdate would not function	2
just too numerous to list fm radio , which has weak reception , but at least it there , and a microphone , to name just two	2
it doesn 't stink , ever \( like some have assumed since it doesn 't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon \)	1
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n 't take weeks to figure out how to operate	1
i tried the cd setup program without any luck	2
my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units	2
i even downloaded the product 's user manual useless	2
after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd	2
overall the phones fantastic , and i would have given it 5 stars , but its not perfect	1
just bought one i 've enjoyed it to date	1
great picture quality in automatic mode , quality is great	1
but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in `` auto `` mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !	1
same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex nothing	2
it 's still alive , still kicking , and still playing	1
i feel much less likely to drop this phone than others , which are actually starting to get too small	1
i love the quality of the pictures	1
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to maneuver through the menus quickly	1
this camera takes amazing pictures and its size can not be beat	1
i would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn 't for the fact that i would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone	1
i decided to save the and opted for the zen xtra and i was not disappointed	1
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate	1
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product	1
we found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader , there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used	2
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !	1
this phone is a winner	1
the setup software did everything	1
one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough	2
i 'm in high school , and this camera is perfect for what i use it for , carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to , of my friends and of funny things that happen	1
at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod	1
the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files	1
great sound good interface replaceable , powerful battery good software wake up , sleep timers multiple play modes	1
especially the lcd is big and the camera quality is among the very best around	1
first , it really is tiny the size of a pack of cigarettes , maybe a scotch deeper	1
it was immediately noticeable that nis slows down my computer \( pent4 , 256 ram \)	2
the included earbuds were uncomfortable	2
we have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck \( we always wrap them in the dirty diaper \)	1
not only is it functional and runs super smooth fast , but it is also eye candy	1
diaper champ is by far the best diaper pail !	1
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity an exceptional close up shooting capability	1
the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it	1
now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !	1
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo enthusiast would want	1
customer service awful listen to this one , remember the battery statement i made earlier	2
four megapixels is great	1
the build quality feels solid , it does n 't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch \( both dots and dd5 1 sound good \)	1
1 the phone has the best keypad any nokia phone has to offer	1
it has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point and shoot we 've ever tested	1
strong points design small , comfortable , curved , and stylish	1
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing \( i recommend www no madness net \) , and price wise zens are unbeatable	1
having done all this , i was quite pleased to see that all corners i needed were decently covered by the signal	1
range of functions as indicated above it has something for everyone point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography	1
second might be a problem i might have with my pc but not too sure , when the player is connected on the usb and i start playing on it and also using the windows explorer , it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronize with the pc during play , which is a bit irritating	2
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode	1
bottom line great phone for the time being	1
you can 't change the battery , so i don 't know what i 'm going to do in a year or so	2
the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4 times optical zooms gets you just that much closer	1
perhaps i bought the micro to be different , the cheaper price tag \( from amazon \) , the design , or avoiding the high ipod theft in nyc subways	1
it plays alternate video formats \( cads , svcds , cods \) very well	1
if there was a zero star rating i would give it	2
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology	1
additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screen saver , stop clock , alarm , java applications \( chess , currency converter etc \)	1
slow syncro flash , macro infinity mode , etc	1
at first glance , i thought this phone was a little too big for me , maybe a little too complicated	2
3 \) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff	1
and the body construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330	2
if you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday , nokia beats everyone else	1
the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did	1
this is a great phone i have this phone since feb 04 and i never have any problem at all	1
when the screen stops working , you 're out of luck !	2
lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options	1
it seemed as if we were emoting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless	2
the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software	2
night mode is clear as day	1
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit	1
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into	1
the hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately	2
you can `` disable `` some of the individual components , but don 't be fooled they 're still there and running	2
the sound quality is excellent \( and i 'm fussy with that stuff \) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod \( besides the price , but everyone knows that \)	1
great reception , visibility and interface \( may be complicated by others \)	1
you need the software to actually transfer files	2
tech support from apex is literally nonexistent	2
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device	1
i am an advanced computer user , so i can not even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work !	2
can 't beat carrying 500 cd collection with me wherever i go	1
otherwise , this is a great `` alternative `` mp3 player for those of use who don 't want to worship the mighty all powerful apple	1
navigation could be better , but there is n 't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it	2
i did n 't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out	2
there seem to be fewer collisions and dropped packets as i read from the router logs than with my old dlink router	1
t simply the best player on the market for a really low price , so why look anywhere else \?	1
it really is the perfect travel camera , plus it offers the convenience of digital photography	1
i 've had nothing but good luck with t mobile	1
hard drive screws up occasionally	2
2 \) not very ergonomically you 'll find even for a point and shoot lens \)	2
3 \) the lack of an intermediate resolution setting , as other reviewers have suggested , is a problem , but that problem is meaningless with a larger compactflash memory card	2
! ok , score 7 0 oh yes , the newest color of this phone is quite cool	1
i highly recommend this phone to anyone	1
you even can not navigate by genre artist album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division	2
i would put the hitachi up with the best !	1
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box	1
it works with a minimum of fuss	1
i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused	2
my sd500 focuses flawlessly , does not `` whine `` during video , and my pictures are razor sharp	1
i guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler	1
solid , high quality construction	1
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package	1
if you have to buy a camera on a bu get , this has got to be the one	1
it did also seem to have a strong `` new electronics `` smell for some time	2
the photostitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots	1
4 \) the viewfinder is bordered lcd skying	2
all in all , this is a wonderful device	1
it is some protection for the unit , but for use ability , forget it	2
i find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much	2
for the price it is a well spent investment !	1
only con i can think of is no camera	2
so far it has been very durable \( other than the little pads on the earbuds \) , but those aren 't really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own	1
when talking the voice is not very clear	2
i 've had no problems w this phone	1
i left the camera in my car in maine \( not a very hot place \) and the lcd screen cracked !	2
2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide angle wc e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured	2
this makes for a great phone	1
have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility	1
so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly	2
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature	1
it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter \?	2
when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn `` t work either !	2
2 you still have to clean the thing ! !	2
i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc	2
the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good	1
the manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance \( but there is no manual focus or manual exposure \)	1
transferring files couldn 't be easier thanks to the included software bundle	1
it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot	2
im at full capacity ! ! ! ! i called syman tic and they said they don 't know why but i should get tech 's support at 35 hr to help ! ! i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes until i hung up !	2
i sent creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don 't seem to even want to help	2
even with the waterproof housing it is small	1
seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection	2
compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use	1
the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy	2
mine installed no problem \( but i did uninstall my norton anti virus 2002 personal firewall 2002 first \)	1
even the `` shorter `` battery life , though , has not impaired my positive experience with the zen micro in any way	2
software downloads on the site crashed my pc	2
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time	1
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby	1
still , that 's enough time that i 'm still satisfied , if a bit grouchy with creative 's over hyped promises	2
this way i never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones , i can get whatever i want	1
this router does everything that it is supposed to do , so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it	1
after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc creative 's online support was no help at all	2
scroll button the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling	2
it also works just fine for international calls	1
i loved this product when i first got it great sound , easy to use \( even though i agree that the software was n 't the best \) and held enough songs to suit any mood	1
i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed \( mainly the slow processor \) , and then i couldn 't get the damn thing off my computer completely !	2
after 10 years , i now downloaded mccaffee 's product after calling their support they answered quickly , and for free , and were very helpful	2
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable	1
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging	1
so , don 't buy this or upgrade	2
i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy	2
all in all , it 's a good router if you don 't have the cash for a speed booster one	1
it 's shorter , sleeker , more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the ipod my nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy !	1
the sd500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed	1
the latest of internet security has antispam function that is helpful because i has received a mountain of those these days	1
this setup using the cd was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time	1
this thing does everything but washes your dishes	1
seriously ! i love it !	1
i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful	1
finally , compare the ipod to other players on a cost gb , and also consider ease of use	1
radio quality weak reception	2
the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap	2
playlists can be generated on the fly \( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus \) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options	1
the power is incredible , it cut through md and plywood like butter	1
i have the black one and adore it	1
what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds	2
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money saver since ipods , rivers , rca , dell , all have built in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician \( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement \)	1
the focus is great , though , if you are not taking a macro shot	1
it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims	1
the bass is deep and the treble is clear	1
it 's such a great camera ! i think it really was worth the investment \)	1
the camera res ponce is very quick	1
the diaper champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle	1
big lcd screen at least for me , 2 `` is enough	1
good quality video	1
i can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images , calender events , contacts and anything else	1
we use regular kitchen sized garbage bags	1
i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n 't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as \( i believe \) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked	2
its also smaller , and gets more looks	1
i just got an older 866 mhz system with 512 pc 133 ram and it also runs fine on that	1
the free \( i didnt know they still did that \) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need \( except good headphones \)	1
it has a handsfree loudspeaker , conference and transfer !	1
i wanted this product because i didn 't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended	1
looks sleek , compact , has a radio	1
this product is by far the best broadband router on the market , i bought this to replace one of those linksys instant wireless b routers , worked great for about a year	1
t610 supports only midi files	2
player works and looks great if you can get the dvd 's to play	1
the player is great	1
and i can 't warn you enough to stay away from norton ! !	2
the hard case they give with it must work well	1
the front cover \( which you remove to take out the battery \) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid	2
i upgraded from a very small 3 2 max camera to this camera with great results	1
the other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this	2
apparently , t mobile is heavily back logged and can 't keep up with demands	2
it is a very amazing product	1
the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this	2
i am glad that i do not work for norton	2
another 5 star performance	1
it was a symantec error	2
i am an it professional and have used norton for years , but this product is a complete and utter dud	2
this is really a no brain er	1
using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient	1
easy to use a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	1
ok , not quite everything but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it	1
this thing seriously is a good player though	1
also , the display is `` hinged `` and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage	1
the machine itself seems fine , but the software that came with it is awful	2
3 bags are easy to change	1
i tried to use the fm radio option , but it doesn 't seem to really pick up the stations i listen , however i am going to try it in a different location , it may have just been my residential location	2
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price	1
whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio	1
removable battery	1
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers	1
eax equalizer accentuates diminished quality of mp3 files	2
i 've since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable , but are too similar to ipod 's and can target ipod thieves here in nyc	2
this is one of the best purchases we made	1
i can 't smell anything \( and believe me , this is quite something with my baby \)	1
other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won 't disappoint any already established nokia phone fans	1
picture quality 's great for still and video with sound	1
if you 've been listening to cd 's in your car for awhile , dealing with the drop off in sound quality may take some getting used to	2
i purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of nokia phones available	2
you can turn this phone into a gaming machine , a camcorder or a digital camera , an mp3 player , a movie viewer , a voice recorder , a personal secretary , a gaps map browser , a book , a multifunction remote controller , practically everything that you can do with the computer , plus it is a phone \( ! ! \) and also you can carry it in your pocket \)	1
its sleek design , large memory capacity , compatibility with itunes , and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market	1
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use	1
although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent	1
well linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry	1
but those 2 come up every time	2
iriver has a better fm receiver built in , but the drawback to iriver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed	2
i 'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies \( such a samsung and motorola \) it might be good but if you 're getting a nokia , don 't get this one	2
being a past norton customer , i consider this to be a slap to my face	2
this model appears to be especially good	1
the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it 's only by about 10 or so	2
i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use	2
2 take around 10 , 000 640x480 pictures	1
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images	1
there was occasionally a lip sync issue \( the lips were n 't moving in time to the dialog \)	2
and i must say this mp3 is very cool	1
the depth adjustment was sloppy	2
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen	1
bottom line if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services , and are willing to deal with the possibility \( not the certainty \) of setup gremlins , by all means get the zen micro	1
controls easy yo use and easy to get to	1
the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly	2
es , the interface took a little getting used to , but once i did , it 's almost second nature now	2
but it you won 't regret it	1
the in ital setup of the router was simple	1
software is absolutely terrible	2
there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good	1
when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken the motor would not eject discs or close the door	2
i could take 1 2 `` passes and it still didn 't skip a beat	1
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files	1
it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches	2
the only knock i have is that the flash is underpowered	2
i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience	2
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to	2
it looks sleek and modern	1
when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n 't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with	1
honestly , i love this player	1
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons	2
anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it	1
slick looking design and improved interface	1
the only thing i do n 't like about this is the cover does suck	2
even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	2
over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !	1
very good `` every day `` camera fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos	1
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player	1
the setup was very easy	1
i just upgraded to the linksys wrt54g wireless g router last month and i am very happy with the quality of the product	1
we got two phones for the t mobile family plan \( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan \) and one came with a broken headphone \( can hear but can not be heard \) and one died today after less than two weeks of use	2
7 \) chic look and good build the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate	1
this unit comes with the usb firewire cable as a standard item now	1
the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie `` extras `` on them on the two occasions when i tried to do that	2
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying	1
one still works fine , the other quit after one day	2
so far the software for the pc works easily	1
first of all , the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos , sound clips , photos , texts , etc	1
i am now staring at an array of stuff including zen micro player , stereo earbud headphones , a rechargeable lithium ion battery , an ac dc power adapter , a usb 2 0 cable , a belt clip , a stand , a stylish cloth pouch , an installation cd , a quick start guide , and creative mediasource software	1
i 've since gotten the linksys modem \( befcmu10 \) and stacked it with the wrt54g router and it works fantastic ! ! !	1
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength	1
the downside being that the tito can only connect at 802 11b speeds and not 802 11g	2
the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me	1
at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my `` alias `` dvds as well	2
i 'd give it 4 5 stars if possible , but since 5 stars would be misleading , i give it 4 stars	1
i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too	1
the other pail i used started to smell after 2 weeks of use	2
the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone `` unlike the nokia 3650 `` and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make	1
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly \( dangerous when you 're driving at night \) , and there 's no way to change this	2
the 6600 \( t mobile \) is the true 'world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe , including new zealand and australia \( 900 \) whereas the 6620 \( available from singular \) replaces it w 800mhz \( some refer to as 850 \)	1
i , as many others , have waited for many years for the convergence of price , features , size and ease of use to hit that happy center point	1
recently the variable speed control went out	2
the phone must be shut down taken apart to change the memory card and turning the phone back on takes a little while	2
4 \) the camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away	2
i can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time , it is that simple	1
2 it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow	2
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away	1
also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn 't have any extra knobs or gizmo 's	1
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible	1
don 't use them , so i delete them for addle space	2
the music is easy to get to \( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i pod owners say \) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen	1
once installed , however , some of the functions do work ok \( disk doctor , one button checkup , and win doctor \)	1
the new canon s300 is 33 larger and 26 heavier than the s100	1
apex sucks !	2
headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature	2
not only is it the perfect size \( not too small , not too large \) , it also has all the features a high tech phone user would want	1
i am impressed with this camera inside and out	1
up , down , left , and right would have given me better control	2
i still need to read up on some of the security settings , etc to fully understand all that 's up there , but bottom line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the speed boost router	1
in addition it is very easy to setup	1
when i purchase software , i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry !	2
i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright	1
1 it uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills	1
but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything	1
record memos using the built in microphone	1
the sound is amazing	1
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up	1
no smell , easy to use with one hand free , and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don 't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are impossible to find !	1
about the only legitimate criticism from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder	2
nice things about the m12v in a table , the powerful 3 1 4 hp motor is great soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on continuously variable speed control amazon 's price	1
there technical service isn 't helpful either they just read what 's on their website and charge you 50 \( toll fees \) to do it	2
i 've had a lot of cameras , but this one is actually being used , and not stored in a desk it 's all ways in my shiest pocket	1
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player	1
however , it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all dosn 't work at all in the car , for example	2
but this by far is the best phone out there right now !	1
the auto focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject	2
in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered	2
i know this unit will have problems in the future and the 40 for the 2 year `` no questions asked `` replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days which in itself is totally ridiculous !	2
also , the lens cap design is flawed	2
download it fast to your computer	1
this is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory , for example	1
most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy	1
being a very economical person , i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system i never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills	1
it 's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch	1
pertaining to the speed issue i got 54mps while i was in the same room	1
this one is really great	1
great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it	1
you have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost	2
its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge \( not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips \)	2
although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone	1
the ringtones are beautiful , the screen is super high quality	1
\( it had locked up multiple times previously , but always managed to work after wards \) this time , the touch screen wouldn 't respond to me and none of the buttons worked	2
it 's easy to use not too small , and not too big	1
transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad	1
not only is it inconvenient , but also the battery life span is short	2
1 no direct firewire to the camera	2
norton internet security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations	2
the pop up blocker and anti spam are bonuses	1
after getting one for christmas from amazon , i 'm now a believer the digital elph is truly the world 's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures	1
best camera ever from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything	1
the look feel i have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambiance	1
but , the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious , serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw , and i 'm going to tell you what it is but first , two more things about this piece of garbage that 's so great and could 've made it a potential ipod killer	2
the 6600 was the best phone i could find with these options that i could get with t mobile	1
i love the diaper champ , it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn 't cost an arm and a leg for refills	1
i can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than motorola 's do , but as long as i 'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine	1
for my first i had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky	2
i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and or lots of features you would find in a pda	1
the dvd player is fine	1
the user support service isn 't too great either	2
if you need a wireless router get it get it get it works really good	1
the diaper champ is the best we found !	1
the sound is just fine	1
so far i haven 't had so much complaints except that i still haven 't mastered how to scandisk when using internet security	2
uploading the images to my windows based pc is very fast and simple	1
the player 's software is very easy to use and very good	1
perhaps semantic could work out the efficiency a little , but these reviews are highly exaggerated i would ask what else these people are running on their computers \( \? \)	1
the controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed	1
overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera	1
to use the creative zen player with a subscription service , you need to go to creative 's web site , and download new software for your pc	2
you can use the player to store your computer data files \( good feature to have \)	1
i 'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop , but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until linksys improves their desktop software hardware	2
first , it serious , serious installation problems	2
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc \( 2 4 hz with 1gb ram \) with 52x drive	1
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands	2
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone	1
it 's important that people know the following first , the interface is slow	2
i actually took a friends word on it and went with this champ when registering and i am glad i did	1
the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n 't be easier to use	1
the af feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3 4 of the screen and the image still looked normal	1
the height adjustment works well not perfect	1
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player	1
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all	1
this product is a lifesaver ! !	1
the included memory card is too small	2
2 \) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera \( semi serious amateur photographer \)	1
don 't care about sunlight it 's tft	1
at 128 the songs sound very good	1
all in all , not very good	2
3 \) the case hides the display you have to open it to see what you are doing	2
but , i would definately recommend this phone	1
the `` movies `` last about 5 seconds	2
9 \) wake up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time	1
the included leather pouch is a big plus it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices	1
it will read and play all cd audio disc	1
yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them	2
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc	1
the eq is awful , and even at top volumes , the bass is flat sounding	2
do not buy this product	2
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1 250 of a second with third party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon	1
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing	1
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures	1
5 the price is right	1
i had some issues when i had enabled wep encryption and then moved on to wpa	2
this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks	2
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely \( as all of my pictures have thus far \)	1
the touch buttons do take a little getting used to and i don 't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an `` enter `` key , but you get used to it and it isn 't a big deal	2
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category	1
i purchased two of these beauties	1
this is overall the best point and shoot camera i 've used	1
1 speakers at home , i rarely use it with the earbuds , though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players	1
sometimes , it needs few minutes to open an application	2
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down now buy it !	1
i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again	2
however , there is a more detailed pdf manual on the cd \( and online \) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the zen micro	1
the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group	1
its a tough one this unless you wan na drive your car over it	1
overall i 'm happy with my toy	1
our norton internet av 2004 was terrible right from the get go , so i 'd think that if steelworks is ok now , it should remain ok	2
ease of use design the ipod is a very easy to use mp3 player , and if you can 't figure this out , you shouldn 't even own one	1
the only problem i have with the buttons is that the power button and print share button don 't have a nice click	2
1 \) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n 't want to bother with the settings	1
3 \) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players	2
a sony erickson may be the phone for you but good luck finding one w all the features such a competitive price	1
the battery is also convenient , but could have been better , such as the zen touch 's battery \( but at least this one is removable \)	1
depressing the scroll button \( for selecting \) is not always responsive	2
i bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and i absolutely love it !	1
even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start up	2
i also tend to like the sliding cover on switch found on many compact ps cameras since it 's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot	1
the wrt54g plus the hga7t is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard walled house as was my case	1
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime	1
audio formats supports both mp3 , wma and yeah , wav too	1
the software , which comes with player is not good at all	2
i do n 't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags	1
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well	1
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !	1
the design and construction are excellent as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics	1
operating its many features is easy and often obvious i 'm no annie levitt 's , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store	1
i tried e mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable	2
without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !	1
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player \( at that size and the price \)	1
if you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty , this is the player to get ! highly recommended	1
the song quality of the ipod is excellent , and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory , for most users	1
n6600 supports midi , wav , arm , mp3 etc	1
the fm tuner , the 5g of storage , and the removable disk are all great features	1
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n 't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there	1
well , i have an ipod mini and i really like it , but all in all , i like the zen micro more	1
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised	1
the phone is very light weight	1
and if you 're a mac user like me , they 've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative	2
i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad	2
like most of their solutions \( which first blame other applications for errors \) , the tech persons line was that this was probably a microsoft error it was not	2
there is no odor and it is very easy to use	1
sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan 't up to the task	2
we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it !	1
i highly recommend it	1
the extra gb is just a bonus	1
they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered	1
what i dont like nothing much except headphones , belt clip design	2
bright , visible screen	1
also , diapers tend to stay in the middle , causing the pail to get backed up	2
if someone asked me flat out , i 'd say to go woth something else	2
so far the dvd works so i hope it does n 't break down like the reviews i 've read	1
all the `` cool `` features of the mini , but with 20gb instead of 5	1
this camera is closest to perfect than any other diagram that is 4 5 megapixel	1
the dynamic playlists \( `` now playing `` , i be live creative calls it \) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate	2
other than the fact that one can 't delete a file directly from the ipod , the interface is excellent and mind numbingly simple to use	1
well , i got my second player , and right out of the box it wasn 't working right and once again , after consulting customer se !	2
i think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open close scanning that it does with every program	2
however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my dix rips	2
works perfectly with my netgear wireless paramecia	1
the songs recorded with fm are as good as the original signal	1
the menu pops up after 3 seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory	2
features really , there aren 't any features , unless you call the games a feature	2
\( it sure does look nice , though ! \) i recommend this to any music lover anywhere the quality of the audio is excellent , the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive , and the storage capacity and battery life are huge !	1
we resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the diaper champ for wet diapers only	2
i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy	1
colors 10 variety of hot colors made it difficult to choose from	1
the service from the supplier was exceptional	1
the first one would n 't work from the start	2
some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone , and it has rightfully gotten the nick name `` the bar of soap `` which , it really is	2
my only significant complaint is sound quality	2
the speed control is well designed and it works perfectly	1
the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception \( that is , in places where you get t mobile coverage , which is not that good see below \)	1
all in all , the diaper champ serves its purpose , but it does not live up to its good reviews	2
and it holds so much music and audio files	1
they will not respond to my emails \( promised turnaround time is 24 hours \) and the phone line is constantly busy	2
4 \) no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras	2
5 the zen does not have a stop button !	2
i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy	1
the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily	2
no proprietary headset jack	2
the dvd player does not work properly	2
it only read the dvds 10 of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen	2
i 've always liked symantec products , except for this version 2004	2
have used it frequently and have had no problems	1
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice	1
i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for reaping the damned thing	2
i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be	1
because of it 's hidden features \( no macro vision , non regional \) i keep this baby around to watch non american region dvd 's	1
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough	1
however after just one month my headphone jack was broken as a result of normal , every day use	2
incredible memory !	1
the entire unit was poorly crafted	2
the best 4 megapixel 4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use	1
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer	1
booting up my computer took forever ! ! !	2
the software has been installed on windows 95 , 98 , 2000 and xp and i haven 't had any problems with it	1
it 's cheaper , holds more songs and is smaller	1
if this machine just stops on you , unplug it quickly and get out of the way !	2
i just bought this player today and i already love it	1
one caveat i have is that i understand the ipod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved	2
about 10 of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc	2
pc cable is too expensive 50 for a usb cable \?	2
the gprs web access is slow !	2
i got a 1gb mmc upgrade for this phone and now i can	1
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography	1
the new hardware version does not run linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half	2
no one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor '	1
features click wheel to navigate ability to work with windows or mac optional back lighting \( you can have it on all the time , or have it shut off to save battery power after 5 , 10 , or 20 seconds \) ability to download pda info automatic or manual download from itunes when ipod is plugged into your computer	1
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like	1
i 've had nokia 's for years , and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use a phone	2
i find this feature on this phone useless , but , since i don 't really need this function anyway , i don 't really use it	2
i was looking for something that wasn 't too complicated to use and to help the pics i post on ebay show more detail	1
after 3 months , it stopped playing higher number scenes on dvds	2
8 battery life is excellent	1
if you are using linux , and you want to use gprs to connect to the net , i suggest this phone along with a belkin usb bluetooth adapter	1
the software you get with this camera is perfect	1
also , i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software , which i had with audigy zs sound card originally it is definitely an added plus	1
the menu is easy to use and understand	1
i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched !	1
the picture quality surprised me , when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good but i was wrong !	1
to address two previous somewhat negative reviews \( 1 \) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder	2
the number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area , the fonts are small , the interface is too convoluted and frustrating , it 's not that customizable as well	2
for those mac osx users out there , isync works fairly well	1
however , the battery life is good enough you should n 't be overly concerned with turning this phone off	1
4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera	1
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player	1
customer service and technical support are overloaded and non responsive tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them	2
a distinct ipod relation is evident with white colored cables , power plug and the very nice zen case with a white rubber inside covering	1
the battery has a long life	1
the actual experience of using the ipod is magnificent	1
with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority \( for high speed subjects \) , aperture priority \( for focal length \) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality	1
it 's a highly rated , kick ass firewall program that 's bundled with the venerable norton antivirus , plus extras \( like norton antispam norton parental control \) that make this security suite a must have for people who have broadband internet access	1
the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as 1 \) not recognizing a dvd 2 \) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 \) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd	2
the quality is significant and you 'll be very happy from saving time and the headache	1
all of this said as it 's on it 's way back to amazon , the one song it did include provided far better sound than the ipod	1
it has never worked	2
do n 't buy this player	2
the instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually	2
when you learn how to change some settings , you can make the quality even better	1
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used	1
the cons , at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth	2
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation a slightly audible click if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n 't even notice the click	1
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it	1
i could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point , but this pr duct seems to work very well so far	1
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities	1
ripping your songs and creating playlists could n 't be any easier	1
built in microphone is great for recording short voice notes	1
to install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called symantec or nortron , also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted	2
with accessories , you can make the ipod into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster	1
i 've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces , and it still works flawlessly	1
its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n 't since with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , etc like the ipod \( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device \)	2
the pictures are absolutely amazing the camera captures the minutest of details	1
after comparing the included creative earbuds directly against my sony md e828lp 's and sennheiser mx 400 's , i find myself still using the creative 's , which in my opinion , sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord	1
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful	1
looks ok very shiny chrome and mirrors	1
they are razor sharp , the color balance is perfect , and the focus is great	1
it is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags , easy to clean , and most important , easy to use one handed just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle	1
the ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily	2
if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with isync , i say stick with a sonyericsson	1
loading cds was somewhat time consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well	2
it also costs a lot less than the ipod	1
the dual antenna is a plus and the design is slick	1
i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few issues	2
only thing missing from creative is a cd burner	2
1 i achieved my basic objective my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more	1
3 \) 4x zoom is nice	1
so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out	2
the price is more	2
3 \) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software	2
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense filters choices	1
downloads are a snap and quick	1
a lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for napster to go the firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it	2
but , all of this means nothing , because of the serious , serious , stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw after 3 months , give or take a few weeks , you won 't be able to hear anything	2
linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding	1
all in all this a great player that blows the i pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound \( which is all that matters in a mp3 player \)	1
	1
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly	1
only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing	2
this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great	1
what a kick butt mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source , instead of paying for them two or three times , then get the creative zen ipod killer , kiss my ass itunes !	1
gets stinky after a few months , the seal on the piston doesn 't seal anymore	2
the player 's mechanics are also flawed	2
i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100 , and of course i got the latter !	1
if you want a sharp looking , fast digital camera and you don 't need or want manual controls , then this is the camera for you !	1
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx \( on the pc \)	1
very sleek stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has	1
excellent picture quality on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jv players	1
after a recent update , i can no longer open more then 1 browser window	2
first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good	1
the battery is removable	1
overall build quality , good macros results , impressive video quality , good pictures with flash \( good colours , sharp results \) , excellent auto white balance	1
actually , the creative zen micro solves all that	1
it was no problem for me to use their software	1
this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked \( after about 3 weeks \)	2
i am happy with the fact that i can use any bag in there and dont ' have to pay out the nose for replacements	1
plus , if you order from amazon com , they will exchange it for you no problem	1
this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product	1
when i opened the box , i was shocked by the size of this thing it 's tiny !	1
only slight negatives i 've had so far is that i haven 't been able to get it to accept any of my wav files yet	2
secondly , all info can be sent to a computer and w o the hassle of usb wires	1
it 's too bad , though , that !	2
the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub par	2
this is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks	1
the color and light i captured with this camera on a 12 day trip to turkey \( gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques \) were far superior to anything i 've ever gotten with a traditional 35 mm film camera	1
the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a tad too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line	1
3 \) folders can not be created for the audio files	2
overall though , i 'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player , even if it is to pretend your not a brain dead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod \)	1
5 \) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control	2
d \) software is another great misfortune hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on	2
basically , i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help	2
what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software	2
i was impressed by this very inexpensive player for the first three hours , and then it died	2
in fact , people who have been present while i changed my almost 3 month old son 's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent ' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once i dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ	1
new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays	2
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use	1
there is no way you can talk with customer care about this	2
with the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn , it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones	1
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel	1
it is nokia and thus easy to access the menu options	1
the log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways	1
i 'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable	2
8mb for a camera like this is a joke	2
now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will !	2
also , some other mp3 players such as the nitrus allow you to play wma \( windows media audio \) files , whereas the ipod does not	2
only problem is that is a bit heavy	2
the headphone jack seems to be a major problem	2
there were no other obvious setup instructions though there was a soft copy manual , it did not give an answer readily on what do to	2
the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warranty period is to expire	2
this player is an ideal purchase	1
5 \) the cheap , user replaceable battery \( 50 from creative \) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs 100 to replace	1
all at the same time , and all without a hitch	1
the touch pad would be a great thing if it worked well , and as i never had issues getting songs transferred to the player , i did have problems accessing them from the player	2
i have stored 40 audio cds and i still have close to 2 8 gb free	1
it feels like i 'm back to the days of 56k dial up internet service , even though i 'm running a dell 2ghz pentium 4 with 256mb memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year	2
2 \) storage capacity	1
it had issues right off the bat , with freezing up , staying in 'shutting down ' mode , and just not functioning very well in general	2
made the camera totally inoperable	2
the program brings more problems than a virus , albeit not as major problems , just not what you expect for 70 bucks	2
the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive	2
i still like it a lot and am not changing it for another , but it is sort of stinky	2
also , when i dial an `` 800 `` number like an airline , it will not allow me to use number keys to navigate the prerecorded menu	2
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results	1
especially for the price amazon gives it at \( i was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications \)	1
ive had this phone for a year now and its the best phone i have owned	1
tough as nails	1
their customer \( www apex digital inc com \) service is very poor	2
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made	1
i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media	2
good sound plays very nicely , even though the stock headphones are kind of weak durable not the most durable because its mostly plastic , but very compact and sturdy	1
in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !	1
i purchased this phone for just 50 and there is no end to what i can do with it	1
don 't buy the diaper champ	2
this time , it started the installation process , then i left for work i think it will work i hope it will work	2
this is a wonderful camera	1
3 \) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff	1
the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line	2
i just wished that it didn 't fill up so fast !	2
even when i set it to low , it 's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what i want it to do	2
\( every now and then i spray down the inside of the pail with lysol \) easy one hand use impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers out of the pail every now and then odors do escape the pail , but that is rare and it usually just means that we 've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag	1
all you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network	1
problems with the sound quality were evident right away , but even i couldn 't imagine they 'd be that bad	2
we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far all claiming to work `` apex `` dvd players and none worked	2
if you do n 't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders	2
also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying	2
upside this one , like most nokias , receives a consistently strong signal \( i 've tried some samsung and sony ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front \)	1
the champ works great	1
the one i purchased for a friend as a gift will not read any dvd disc	2
it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras	2
i love the camera	1
however , it has failed to deliver on quality	2
the pc side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated	2
the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance	2
no in box accessories an arm strap , belt strap , case , or anything would be nice , but nope moveable parts this makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th with moveable parts , its easy to damage an ipod at a gym , so this is for more casual listeners note the ipod mini doesn 't have moveable parts and is made of titanium	2
unfortunately , the touch pad issues non intuitive and poor instruction guide killed it	2
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing	2
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 of the shots that i take	1
2 \) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong	2
i just replaced my old linksys router with this one , turned everything on in the right order , and it was up and running with no problems	1
it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist	1
start up is so quick	1
very bad quality	2
it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix	1
the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots	2
even with that , i highly recommend this router outstanding performer	1
better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility	1
i then realized a major design flaw	2
new firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration	1
i thought this camera was awful and i did tons of research on cnet and other sites	2
i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good	2
first , the sound quality is okay , but \( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned \) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes	2
am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !	1
the software is very easy to use , and the transfer is super fast !	1
my `` fast forward `` button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go	2
1 creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog burn music if you are starting from scratch but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen \( 278 cds 3 , 400 tracks 12 5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps \) and guess what \?	2
only downside is when taking pictures in low light conditions without the flash	2
overall , a very disappointing product	2
t mobile wasn 't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate	2
now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk	2
drops and strong signals even from the backyard	1
but the sound is very good \( and loud \) and works well on my portable speakers	1
along the way we compared it to my wife 's t720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life , connectivity bars and features	1
the hitachi has plenty of power , runs smooth , and cuts effortlessly through maple \( with freud bits ! \)	1
speaker phone quality is good , and poping in a 512mb mmc card , it rocks !	1
although the sd500 takes great quality photos , the sensitivity of the lcd compromises the quality overall	2
sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about 90 \) , the ability to record with a built in microphone \( great for recording reminders and meetings \) , very sturdy construction , and not to mention the sound quality is excellent !	1
feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products	2
i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason	1
if you experience problems with installation , you can visit symantec 's website , click the support tab , click the 'home or home office support ' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it	2
software is easy to use \( although red hat software is better , but costs money \)	1
1 \) it is perhaps too small	2
the movie mode is also working great	1
i compared it to other cd players \( two models of panasonic , rio samsung \) and they were no way even near zen micro	1
this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n 't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera	1
frankly , i think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware i 've ever used	1
the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead	1
takes excellent photos	1
the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly	1
but it is smooth , it is powerful , it is affordable it has a proven track record	1
its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed 38 phone lying by your pillow side	1
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review	1
it seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound	2
oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet	1
this is extremely lame	2
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery powered appliance	1
the program is fully featured , with much of what you 'd want from a security program	1
i love the performance and features of this router	1
the software that came with it was tough to load	2
this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve	1
i went out and got the canon today	1
way less expensive than the ipod	1
outside of the t mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto at t wireless and various other services where the t mobile service was unavailable	1
an extra gig of room , fm radio , voice recorder , pim applications with sync to outlook	1
the one and most major thing that i was disappointed with , in this player , is the battery life	2
the box included a little polyester , pull string bag , \( yes , you read right a bag , something a boy would carry ten marbles in \) and tries to pass it off as the case	2
probably a great phone overall , and perhaps mine just has bugs	1
you can upgrade but then there 's a certain level of trouble involved	2
a little weighty \( 9 ounces no biggie \) , but otherwise fine	2
my only complaint \( really more of an observation \) is that the outside finish of the ipod is rather delicate , so i am going to get a case for mine so it doesn 't get all scratched up	2
they 're easy to use	1
the extra gb of hard rive space , remove able battery and fm tuner , as well as the fact that i was previously a satisfied owner of the nomad ii put it over the top for me	1
finally , after about a week 's use , the screen started to freeze on me	2
i found that to be the most impressive thing about the ipod 'mini ' basically for ease of use , and the feel it gives	1
no down time , great signal strength	1
seems the `` program scan `` feature did not find the exe file for outlook !	2
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box	1
very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price	1
so i can 't tell you if diaper champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell , but it 's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby !	1
third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer	1
this phone has the best battery , it lasts longer then my old 3210	1
the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual	1
each battery lasts about 10 11 hours	1
if you buying this player to use with napster to go , wait a while	2
it plays everything , even vcd 's	1
the panorama setting is unbelievable !	1
1 \) a spare battery would have been great	2
i wash ours out with lysol each time i empty it , and that helps , but when its hot out well , just be prepared	2
also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display	2
the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train	1
the adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with xp so you are forced to create your document then either print it from windows or export it to another application	2
my daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor	2
it has everything i needed bluetooth , infrared , support for mmc , camera , and a good operating system with lots of supporting software	1
it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies	2
the software could n 't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n 't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6	1
the new drivers on cannon 's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software	2
3 no voice recorder this has also become an important and popular feature that the ipod unfortunately doesn 't have	2
it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features	1
i recommend t mobile and the nokia 6600 without reservation	1
nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear	1
on the plus side it 's packed with features , including bluetooth that works fine it 's really a tiny computer that is also a phone and that 's the negative	2
the tiny \( postage stamp sized \) remote unit is wonderful not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures	1
holds the odor in nicely !	1
i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product	2
the design , as mentioned above , is sleek , cool and trendy \( and i think trendy good , but it 's always hard to tell these days \)	1
the only problem i had was a few components didn 't quite load correctly upon startup , but a reboot fixed the problem	2
lens visible in optical viewfinder	2
6 \) excellent battery life 14 hours beats ipod 's	1
advanced photo bugs will find more creative control than imaginable	1
feature for feature , i find it a very sweet little player equipped with a higher end headphone system , between this and th larger zen hardly use my home stereo system anymore	1
it has an equalizer , but the iriver h10 20gb has a lot more presets than the ipod	2
i like the automatic key lock function	1
excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures	1
the fact that this model would play jpeg slide shows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident \( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature \) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd r data disk without vcd formatting	1
forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds	2
the sound from the player is ok	1
this isn 't uncommon in cameras , though , just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries , you should be fine	2
the player works well with my sony srs a 202 powered speakers	1
avoid this product at all costs	2
as for the zen micro cons i read that every button is touch sensitive , and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front	2
purchased this router a few months back , no problems whatsoever	1
i have been very impressed with my purchase of the sd500 i bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it	1
i couldn 't believe what i had been missing	1
either way , can 't go wrong with this price	1
i find that it is stable in my hands and its ' weight actually contributes to that stability	1
also , it was only 39 99 \( after rebate \) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player	1
i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem	2
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them	1
these tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions , and i found the menu to be much more navigable	1
speed is not a problem	1
the lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don 't need to fuss with a lens cap	1
sound i 'm no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the player had , it was much better than the sound card on my computer and louder too	1
this version of internet security 2004 , is beyond hope	2
i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it	1
for me , it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high quality result	1
the only disappointment so far has been battery life	2
the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple	1
my last simpler nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use	2
the flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent	1
the ipod comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows \( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac \) although the ipod can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so	2
8 \) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows media player , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cb service \( gracenotes \)	1
it is buggy , slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user	2
we are overall pleased with product	1
it has one more resolution of 1024x768 and a `` normal `` compression mode and , it has the 3x zoom	1
ripping the songs , even with my 1 1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good	1
i also did n 't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode	2
only one disk played through to completion successfully	2
very simple to use	1
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad	1
the diaper champ couldn 't be easier to use	1
you must keep double checking depths	2
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on off key is small and difficult to press	2
in low light with flash i found it clear better then the sony p200 \( too much red , colours overall not as natural but fewer red eyes \)	1
navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well	2
the scroll button is sort of annoying to push a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal	2
great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price	1
i mean , they 're short !	2
compared to other leading dd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops	1
1 \) fragile \( i broke the 1st one within 10 days \)	2
if you have an older version of `` internet security `` installed , you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install	2
the dvd player just would 't recognize them	2
firewire usb2 0 for those fortunate enough to have firewire400 , your in for a real treat with auto sync	1
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots	1
i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance \( less than 2 ft \)	2
sound quality excellent , everything you would expect from this company	1
the controls are hard to manipulate , especially in the dark	2
the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption	1
i have had no problems with the phone	1
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm	1
2 \) the player user interface \( ui \) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection	1
however , in my mind , 299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 months	2
i really regret signing up with t mobile , but i 'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract	2
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer	1
great camera , great investment !	1
overall , this router seems like a reasonably priced product th !	1
i first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot	1
what this plug in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware	1
the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use	1
if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception , but the building where i primarily use the micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway , so you can take that for what it 's worth	2
the g3 looks like a work of art !	1
this player seems to work fine with everything else	1
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception \( live in chicago \) , and the customization and applications are awesome	1
the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful `` scene `` mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach snow , sunset etc , are endless	1
however , i suspect that many people are having a bad experience do not purchase this product	2
the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now	2
with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it	1
at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria	1
the good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges , i had a new zen	1
the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use	1
i say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working , but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that i could have done if so !	2
well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise	2
two , the single wrench just doesn 't work well	2
i am getting better speeds on all my web programs	1
is it necessary to scan my ms money database when i close the program \?	2
the power , low noise operation , and speed control makes up for the problems i have experienced	1
i can 't tell you how many times i 've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it	2
there was neither picture nor sound	2
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures \( purple fringing , etc \) so i am very pleased	1
so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost	1
the battery life can 't be very long let 's not be greedy	2
they also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonic 's and sennheisers	1
this is a fantastic tool to use	1
it took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn 't called me yet with any problems	1
2 \) scroll button switch	2
it constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like walls in our house block the link so everything is very slow	2
with one of the most intuitive user interfaces around , seamless bluetooth sync with microsoft outlook , support for thousands of applications for the symbian platform which this phone runs on \( i own the ir remote , iq and a few others \) , the nokia 6600 is all of the above one of the few phones from t mobile that can claim such a distinction	1
crappy headphones	2
it barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzes all over the player , because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart	2
we bought this about 6 months ago and it 's been worthless	2
i can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly	1
bottom line , this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck !	1
great product , easy to use , economical , effective , absolutly fabulous	1
the optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom	1
creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack	2
compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck	1
pros huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery	1
the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n 't as easy as the ipod 's , or as `` sexy `` looking	2
however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experience mega static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6 7 times to get a clear line	2
i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective	2
it does not have an auto focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light	2
the interface , while a bit confusing at first , is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes	1
the micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface	1
the adjustment knob seemed ok , but when lowering the router , i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob	2
the fact that has an open source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion	1
the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive	1
the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily	1
replaceable battery	1
after repeal cleaning and re cleaning , it still stuck after using it for a little while	2
has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousands of songs and organizes them great	1
the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird	2
many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all i would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well	2
\( on here of course \) also , a couple dvd 's would n 't play and they were new ones !	2
even the instruction booklet is out of order	2
the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium	1
i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing	2
itunes can be downloaded from the enclosed cd or for free from the apple site	1
it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs	1
in a week of use i 've never had to reboot the router	1
yes , i recommend it over the competition	1
operation it 's like bmw 's i drive it does it 's job , but has the most unintuitive , overly layered interface	2
this camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact , take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot	1
this is also the case with nis 2004	1
the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window \( now a big deal \)	2
then sorting the files is easy as pie	1
i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files this gives an average of around 60 65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the 57 , 000 mb of free memory available to me	1
the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks	2
i am very pleased with the apex ad2600 it plays just about anything you put in the drawer	1
but now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using freshener	2
it is not reliable	2
3 the remote capture and file viewer software bundled for photo capture is mind blowing	1
on the fly play list creation , address book , removable storage drive capabilities , sound recorder , the list goes on people , this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies , it was like halloween all over again	1
the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject	1
overall it is a great value	1
it is hot enough to be annoying	2
decent battery on the average size , but the 40gb comes with a dock	1
this camera keeps on outfoxing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped	2
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time	1
overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it	1
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available	1
i upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my sony vaio laptop \( xp operating system \)	1
i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well	1
one it 's size it 's smaller than the ipod mini , and holds more music \( 5gb to the ipod mini 's 4gbs \)	1
unit took forever since the beginning to recognize and play discs	2
the biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin 's player was relatively new , it was riddled with scratches	2
if you are looking for a user friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained , than the diaper champ is the one for you !	1
good color and very little needed to correct photos on paint shop pro	1
6600 looks and feels nice	1
it 's easy to install the security on this product but linksys doesn 't do a good job of explaining why its important	1
2 \) music organization is based on id3 \( by genre , artist , album , etc \) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information	2
there are number of downloads needed available for this phone they will be text ed to you at no cost	1
start up , log off , log on everything became very slow	2
3 mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws	2
software the software is crap	2
ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion	1
i love how small the thing is , and the blue glow i 've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all	1
1 \) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera	2
i bought it for my trip to buns aries , and also used it at the iguassu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !	1
thankfully , creative has come through with a product that puts the ipod back in its place	1
after multiple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available	2
my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again \( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating \)	2
the zen offered a great alternative	1
we use the cheap 1 99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around	1
however , it is much bigger , bulkier , and heavier than my other router and i would not like to use it freehand \( i keep it mounted in a table \)	2
i love this player	1
the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle	1
i rarely get drawn in by mass commercialism , but something about the ipod made me say , in the words of lou and andy , `` i want that one ! `` i was willing to shell out	1
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n 't let you take pics with it on which is real good	1
other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as i 'd like them ,	2
i 've have many nokia 's and while this is the best for features , it 's the worst as a phone	2
the outlook syn ch only works for non recurring appointments , which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people	2
the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n 't come in the overused blue	2
with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 \( max is 20 \)	1
installation was as near automatic as can be	1
the only reason for not giving it 5 stars the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player , but in real life i can probably get 6 8 hours at most	2
this is a really great buy , for yourself or as a shower gift	1
the battery life last es 12 hours , and charges quickly \( as mentioned above , the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours not too long at all ! \) once you 've downloaded your music , you can access the tracks by artist , genre , album , composer \( this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist e g covers of songs \) , etc	1
even though i have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer	2
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well	1
\( \) like most soho routers , it has nearly non existant logging	2
i am quite happy with the camera	1
the box is upstairs , and in the farthest room i get connected at 11 18m speed that is similar to the older 10m ethernet standard	1
these people takes lest effort to process rebate forms	2
it 's easy to use , and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch	1
if there were any complaints i have , they are marginal , but one is apples ' proprietary set up for music files , their incompatibility with other music services \( i e napster \) is down right wrong	2
shortly after i brought it , the plunging shafts started sticking	2
i did n 't read a thing about how to operate it it was just intuitive	1
since i use it in a table , i don 't use the plunge feature , but if i ever need it i 've got it	1
it is the 'first generation ' of the player , and while i still agree that it is a great alternative to the ipod , i think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck	2
it has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working \?	2
for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison	1
4 looks great	1
its the easiest thing to setup i thought , and i am only 16 so with all that said , buy the router ! ! ! !	1
in short , the nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution	1
excellent sound quality	1
i 've had no problems with the software	1
this is the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to	1
it 's cute as anything and the glowing blue led looks super cool around the edges	1
few month ago , it 's very popular among my community	1
the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool	1
the prints are beautiful !	1
the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any	1
it is extremely light and disappears in your pocket	1
a call to customer support \( got to a live person within a couple of minutes \) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance	1
also , the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree	1
it is small	1
i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes \( no music i want , but thats just me \) and the creative product was cheaper and i needed to be able to use wma files	1
if the plunging action is critical to your work , look elsewhere	2
it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers	2
i find all of the controls well placed and not flimsy in the least	1
and the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my lan	1
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer	1
20 gb or 40 gb \? the pros of the 40 gb comes with a `` dock station `` and double storage space \( 10 , 000 songs \)	1
the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot	2
we constantly got `` windows virtual memory low `` error messages popping up foll wed by ridiculous slowdowns and or crashes	2
i think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good	1
still has terrible software	2
the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it	1
have a great and easy to use bundled software	1
their site offers no live help at all	2
i must have gotten a good one	1
the handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving	1
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific	1
if you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product , save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version	2
i 'm not overly fond of green but when i used this hitachi m12v it turns out that now i 'm very fond of it	1
this product is absolutely not ready for release	2
this one is full of features \( has bluetooth \)	1
for purposes of clarity , here is my review from that product , edited to be appropriate for this product , since , for the most part , they share many of the same problems	2
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual	1
for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised	1
the fm radio 's reception isn 't spectacular , but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area	2
door broke after a month	2
i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime	1
nis 2003 worked like a charm last year	1
just the home version of norton internet av has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with	2
the sound is bright and clear , the ability to store any mp3 's \( and not just apple approved files \) is great , and i plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time	1
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned	1
i like the speed control	1
this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod	1
as i mentioned in my first paragraph , it supports wpa security , which is far superior to wep	1
i treat the battery well and it has lasted	1
no matter how accustomed to the phone you become , too much time is required to get to , open and close applications	2
their website had a download that helped remove those , although i had to manually remove a good number of files from the `` programs `` directory	1
the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds	1
warning ! the windows `` remove program `` feature does not do a good job of this , and neither does norton 's own removal program	2
but , sometimes , if the champ is too full , the flip handle won 't function	2
you won 't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks	1
sure , this thing is definitely more cost effective than an ipod	1
creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n 't as easy as i would have liked	2
you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with	2
my jpeg pictures are viewable \( not so sharp and vivid \) on my 27 `` screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 `` monitor	2
we tried the `` finding memo `` dvd and when we got to chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason	2
i finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with napster 2 go which is a subscription service , allowing me to download as much music as i want for a 14 95 flat fee	1
i 've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and i truely love it	1
the height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy , but it works well and provides good accuracy	1
from day one , we 've had hangups , crashes , glitches , continual reboots , long shutdowns due to `` cc app exe `` program running which is a norton program	2
i tried disabling the various components provided with this product , paring it all the way back to anti virus only service and saw no improvement	2
i finally got a free support number for norton through my usp support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice	2
the only not so positive comment i have is about the depth adjustment , it is not easy to micro adjust accurately	2
the volume	2
there are a lot of things i like about it	1
i don 't know why cnet says there is a problem with focus , i have all my pictures sharp and high quality	1
after consulting with creative 's customer support , they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair , which would cost me 40 , since it 's past the 90 day warranty \( pretty short warranty \)	2
it is much easier to fill and unload than the diaper genie , plus , why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the dollar store \?	1
4 my idea was that it was an all in one , and that theory once again proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the `` other than phone `` functionalists , you 'll be disappointed if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine but don 't expect to get much done	2
we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken	1
only then did i learn the truth this phone does not work with palm pdas !	2
they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don 't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self timer	1
great colors , pictures and white balance	1
you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour ! \)	1
turn the camera on while pressing the button \( or is it the menu button \? i have to check again \) \) and it 'l show you the time and date	1
the flaw is inside the zen	2
the color screen makes this free after rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive	1
i really dislike holding a phone to my ear , and i 've found the free speak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone	1
this is my second digital camera , but i 'm much more impressed with the canon s100 digital elph than i ever was with my kodak dc240	1
all in all i am pleased with the router	1
i bought this little guy a few weeks back , and i have to say that i never had so much fun with a new toy as this	1
there isn 't much features on the ipod at all , except games	2
the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on off button	2
c \) the scroll bar is a travesty enough said	2
i have a modern pc with lots of speed and memory , but this firewall just brought it to a halt	2
it wo n 't play all of my movies	2
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo	1
the viewfinder does not accurately represent the picture being taken	2
the white led backlit lcd is very bright and crisp , even in sunlight , and relatively easy on the battery	1
it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die	2
5 \) bluetooth wireless technology , so that i can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables	1
if you 're looking for a 3hp plunge router , the hitachi m12v is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget	1
the way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight	2
both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going	2
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it	1
the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera	2
the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there	1
after research of other creative hard drive players , i found that most of them aren 't very durable and tend to crash \( read most reviews on amazon com and see for yourself \)	2
it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great	1
i 'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera	1
pros large hard drive for the 20gb and 40gb are both affordable	1
clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people ! ! !	1
all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved	1
second , it is incredibly easy to use	1
the phone is small , light , and very attractive	1
my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software	2
it is an extremely cool cozmo	1
speakerphone loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch	1
it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full	2
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !	1
i have never had an odor problem !	1
proven canon built quality and lens	1
this did not feel like quality construction and i was n 't sure how long it would last	2
once it froze so bad i couldn 't even use the power button to turn it off , and had to open and take out the battery	2
the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smart phone line	1
when it 's working , it 's great but it is very temper mental	1
the thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome !	1
very sturdy and strong	1
no vibration !	1
what this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for different operating systems !	2
the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well	2
a \) the picture quality \( color and sharpness of focusing \) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging how could one eat rice one grain at a time \) \)	1
here 's the brief synopsis the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of `` plastic like `` \( as if it might break \) , but seems pretty sturdy	1
the phone also sports an image gallery \( with option camera attachment \) , a calendar organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio \( way cool , even if it is just through an ear peice \) , games , java applications and gprs high speed internet connection	1
glad to see the ed revised the previous statements regarding image quality	1
and the remote is cheap and ch easy not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !	2
3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything	2
on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd	2
my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared	1
i wanted standard memory expansion \( cf cards \) , macro mode , and if possible , a waterproof housing \( for kayaking \)	1
i have owned this camera for a short time and would n 't give it up for anything	1
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it	1
mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download	1
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres	1
3660 had similar features , but that is big in size	1
on the up side , the phone has amazing battery life	1
as with most headphones that come with any type of music player , i recommend throwing these into the nearest river , unless you like having hard , round pieces of plastic in your ears	2
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in	1
this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones	1
the speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool \( screwdriver or dowel rod \) to effect any speed change	2
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect	1
the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv	1
such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in wrong !	2
among its weak points is the mmc slot location and a bit vague design	2
it gives you the most bang for your buck , period	1
the ss body is wonderful , feels high quality	1
as the 6600 uses 900mhz , it operates in more countries than the 6620	1
this product is way cooler than anything ive used before \( pencilings and maccabees and norton antivirus alone \)	1
since then , i have not found one major problem with it	1
the installation , set up , and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well	1
owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide	1
the earbuds that come with it are n 't that bad	1
sound this is where i love zen the most	1
we just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are scented and they are like 6 00 and they work great	1
the touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon 't slip which was very thoughtful	1
the only problem is the size of the keys	2
7 mediasource did not install on my personal notebook	2
apex 's website is down and they wo n 't answer their phone	2
also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy	1
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargeable , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have	1
unfortunately , i sold it exactly a month later	2
even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out	2
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down	1
their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific	1
first thing i noticed was that the creative wasn 't well made	2
im able to keep my phone on for about a week \( mostly stand by \) to three days \( regular use \)	1
i liked this one enough to buy another	1
the sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn 't be easier to use	1
if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times , then this is a great camera choice	1
in addition , i don 't believe that it is odorless	2
yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range	1
i have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode , while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera , its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi 8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe \( max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card \)	1
i am very pleased with its quality and durability	1
my main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn 't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag	2
i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered	2
great camera	1
i love the slim design the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky	1
goes 3 days after a charge	1
picture and video quality is ok	1
finding a particular song \( s \) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy	1
relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots	2
cons breaks easily	2
i have no problem using itunes with the zen micro \( in a makeshift sorta way \)	1
very simple and painless	1
6 small but very clear tft screen	1
norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from	1
i recently had to run a 3 4 `` straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn 't even slow down	1
this doesn 't affect standard mp3 files just subscription wma files	2
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector	1
on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm	2
the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it you can 't avoid that	2
overall this is a slightly better than average phone	1
the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog	1
however after purchasing a 20 gb ipod it 's clear to see the superiority	1
the instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the rp ms of the speed settings were mentioned	2
i replaced it with a router raiser and it works much better	2
it is the most bang for the buck out there	1
i was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories \( desk stand hard case , belt clip , wall charger , etc \)	1
it is n 't big and offensive , though you would n 't know it by looking at the pics it takes	1
i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc	1
